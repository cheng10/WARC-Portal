# WARC-Portal  

The project objective is to build extensions to an existing project â€“ warcbase,https://github.com/lintool/warcbase, currently developed by the WALK project,http://webarchives.ca/about.  
The project is being built for digital humanities and social science researchers who wish to access web archive material in their research process.  
The users of the system are experienced researchers who are working on the development of the system at the same time as the students. Many of them will have direct access to the system and will be producing their own scripts for data processing and analysis.  
Digital Initiatives is one of the development departments of the UA libraries. It focuses on providing digital services such as the ERA institutional repository, consulting on research data management, and project management within the library.
