# WARC-Portal

The University of Alberta and it's researchers have a collection of Web Archives, but does not have an easy way to analyze them. The WARC portal project aims to deal with extracting, searching and analyzing web archive files. We plan to provide intuitive and easy access for researchers to browse and search through thousands of possibly duplicated webpages, provide tools for analyzing their collections using an array of searches, filters; and provide helpful visualizations of their data by analyzing keywords used across the web pages and time. We will hopefully provide an invaluable tool for experienced digital humanities and social science researchers. It presents the web archive data in a intuitive way that will help researchers find overall patterns and trends.

### cloneObject

Clone object helper function needed to make sure the copied object is immutable
Object.assign() copies by reference when deep cloning, so we can't use it
     <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign>
Even though JSON functions don't work well with Date(), Regex() and functions,
this implementation is perfect for our needs. Redux needs the state to be serializable and sent to the redux tools,
which means that we couldn't store Date() in state even if we wanted to. Unless we screw the tools.
