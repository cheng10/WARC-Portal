### cloneObject

Clone object helper function needed to make sure the copied object is immutable
Object.assign() copies by reference when deep cloning, so we can't use it
     <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign>
Even though JSON functions don't work well with Date(), Regex() and functions,
this implementation is perfect for our needs. Redux needs the state to be serializable and sent to the redux tools,
which means that we couldn't store Date() in state even if we wanted to. Unless we screw the tools.
