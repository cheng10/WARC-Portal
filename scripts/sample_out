Tompkins Square label presents the 8th volume of Imaginational Anthem, the acclaimed series focusing on acoustic guitar, particularly in the American Primitive vein. Since 2005, the series has revived interest in old masters of the genre while also giving many folks their very first taste of artists like William Tyler, Steve Gunn, Cian Nugent or Daniel Bachman. Volume 8, compiled by hardcore record collectors Michael Klausman (former used LP buyer for NYC's recently shuttered Other Music) and Brooks Rice, features some of the best and most obscure private press guitar records virtually no one has heard. In fact, so-called guitar soli expert, Tompkins Square owner Josh Rosenthal, had never heard of a single artist on the comp (except for Perry Lederman, whose track was Josh's sole contribution to the collection). \"Just goes to show what a bottomless pit music discovery from the past continues to be. There's just no end to all the riches from past decades.\" Amidst the obscure entries are bits of rock-star lore; Joe Bethancourt was supposedly given a sitar by an admiring Jimi Hendrix, and Perry Lederman was reportedly responsible for teaching Bob Dylan how to fingerpick. But the true joy of this collection is derived from discovering incredible acoustic guitar performances completely lost to time. Until now.

As can be expected for the genre, you’ll hear The Cure-style guitars, Echo and the Bunnymen-esque washes of sound, and Ian Curtis-inspired vocals. Which isn’t to say that the album is a mere retread; in fact, it’s full of surprises, from the cinematic orchestration of “Memory” to the delayed, suddenly abrasive intro to “Anxiety.” The album features moments of blistering, brutal beauty, hypnotic riffs, and melancholy melodies. It’s a familiar sound, veering successfully into an uneasy, new direction. Track Listing Side A Titles Artist Length 1. Anxiety Preoccupations 04:29 2. Monotony Preoccupations 02:53 3.

Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences. Schema.org is sponsored by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex. The vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub. A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the sponsors, together with the larger community have come together, to provide a shared collection of schemas. We invite you to get started! View our blog at blog.schema.org or see release history for version 3.1.

It's the perfect blend of Zapp & Roger boogie beats and the chill, neo-funk vocals of Toro y Moi. Finally stepping away from the realm of pure instrumentals, Body Wash introduces Mndsgn's spacey vocals that are so smooth and relaxed, it can easily slip you into a trance. It's simultaneously nostalgic and modern, with digitized vocals, ancient drum samples, and bubbling synths. But it's also a total rejection of the computerized, ultra clear productions of today's hip hop. It's experimental, crazy, and beautiful and it will get you moving. From the opening bop of \"Cosmic Productions\" the sci-fi, anime weirdness pops up with music that gives images of neon colors, large glass windows covered in reflections, and old Toyota Celicas. \"Use Ya Mnd (Twentyfourseven)\" almost sounds like a deep soundtrack cut from the '80s or even a song from an ancient interactive CD-ROM. The smooth synths don't belong in this era and sound so jarring and refreshing, especially as they embrace all their electronic crunch. \"Ya Own Way\" plays like a track from a '90s Sega arcade racing game. The funky bass rhythms over the new agey, soft rhythms are simultaneously haunting, but feel perfect against imaginary imagery of low-polygon cars driving in the night. Light up a joint and sit in a soft chair: this album is a trip like no other. Track Listing Disc 1 Titles Artist Length 1. Overture Mndsgn 01:25 2. Cosmic Perspective Mndsgn 04:19 3.

It was Pop who left the greatest impression on the \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\" band, as they would have a unforgettable run-in with him later in the tour. Related Peter Murphy Returns With Goth Epic 'Lion' Hear the full album as the Bauhaus icon reflects on his career as a pin-up monster The group's drummer, Kevin Haskins, recounts the whole incredible escapade below in an excerpt from his upcoming book, Bauhaus Undead. The book, which also includes tales of the group's liaisons with David Bowie, the Pretenders and Nico, traces the group's original run from 1978 through 1983, as well as their reunions in 1998 and the mid-2000s, with imagery of memorabilia the drummer has held onto over the years. The book includes pictures of the group's handmade flyers, backstage passes, posters, candid photos, set lists, contracts, instruments and handwritten lyrics.  \"I have plundered the vaults to bring forth unseen candid photos, ephemera and flyers that have been entombed for decades!\" Haskins tells Rolling Stone. \"Delved deep inside my memory banks for anecdotes involving hearses, custard pies and flick knives! Fly on the dressing room wall encounters with Iggy Pop, Nico and Bowie. In compiling this slice of life, all my post-punk adventures flashed before my eyes, as they will yours. All captured in one huge, deluxe coffee table book that one can actually touch and hold! And that, in this digital age, is a rarity.\" Here, Haskins recounts Bauhaus' first meeting with Pop, whose \"The Passenger\" would later become a staple of their 1998 reunion set lists. The stunning skyline of Manhattan revealed itself through the flickering strobe effect of the 59th Street bridge. Our first tour of The USA! After landing at LaGuardia, we were now en route into the city, drinking in the sights and smells of Manhattan and feeling every pothole in the well-worn roads. Steam belched from the manhole covers and the rattle of the subway trains, combined with the car horns and sirens, blended together to form an anarchic avant-garde concerto. The cab eventually pulled up to The Iroquois Hotel (where all the bands stayed) on West 44th Street and where, as we discovered on entering our room, the unfortunate guests are outnumbered by an army of resident cockroaches! \"Daniel sat fascinated as Iggy and Mick [Ronson] sparred back and forth about whose production skills were better.\" After our tour manager Peter Kent had paid the cab driver, we dragged our luggage to the front desk to check in. While Peter was dealing with our reservation, I slipped away to check out the music drifting from the hotel bar. I poked my head around the corner and, as my eyes became accustomed to the dark surroundings, I made out an ancient crooner singing an old standard, seemingly for the millionth time. This charming and rundown bar would be the stage for a couple of very exciting meetings. Later that evening, we were all getting ready to go clubbing. New York City! The Big Apple! The energy of the city was palpable as a myriad of discordant sounds invaded our cramped quarters. We were all fired up and excited to hit the town. That is, all but one of us. [Guitarist] Daniel [Ash] had decided to have a quiet night in! It being an oxymoron, we couldn't get our heads round that idea. But no degree of persuasion could change his plans, so we eventually set off without him.   Kevin Haskins' new book 'Bauhaus Undead.' What we didn't know was that his evening in would trump ours by a massive degree! Daniel told us that soon after we left he decided to grab a quiet drink in the hotel bar. After ordering a Jack and Coke, to his astonishment, in walks no other than Iggy Pop, Glen Matlock and Mick Ronson! He literally couldn't believe what his eyes were seeing. After a while, a woman who was with Iggy came over to chat with Daniel. She told him that she had noticed him glancing towards them several times, and enquired if he was a fan. He told her that Mick and Iggy were two of his all-time heroes but that he didn't want to bother them. She reassured Daniel that it would be fine to meet them and eventually persuaded him to join them.   Clocking the British accent, Iggy asked Daniel what he was doing in New York, and so he told him about our upcoming shows. After a couple of drinks, Iggy asked Daniel if he wanted to come up to his room where they were going to have a little party. After considering this invitation for one nanosecond, Daniel accepted and off they went. Upstairs, drinks were fixed and Daniel sat fascinated as Iggy and Mick sparred back and forth about whose production skills were better, and other related topics. It was all conducted in an amiable way, and Daniel could tell that they were best friends. As the night proceeded, Iggy asked Daniel where he could hear our music and Daniel remembered that he had a copy of our single, \"Terror Couple Kill Colonel,\" in our room. Iggy asked him to go get it and Daniel dutifully complied. Eventually, as with all good things, the party came to an end and Daniel returned to our room. As he sat alone, trying to process the surreal nature of the night’s events, the three inebriated amigos returned from their conquest of Manhattan’s underground club scene. As we excitedly recounted the night’s events, Daniel listened patiently, waiting to reveal his unbelievable story. Of course we were all astonished and then wished that we had also stayed in for \"a quiet night.\" The following afternoon, we all decided to visit the bar in the hopes that Iggy would be there. As we entered, our eyes fell upon the familiar face of a solitary figure sitting at the bar. Eying our prize, we all suddenly became very thirsty and duly sat down at the bar to order a round of drinks. Daniel said hi to his newfound pal and introduced the rest of us as we attempted to appear cool and nonchalant. I then heard that old familiar languid baritone drawl of the man himself, \"So this is the rest of the band, eh?\" We responded in the affirmative and invited him to our show that night at Tier 3 and Danceteria one week later. He told us that he was leaving town that night but would try to make it to the latter. After some small talk, he informed us that he had to get back upstairs to his room as Mick Ronson was waiting for him. We enquired if it might be at all possible to tag along. He gave us a wry smile and said his goodbyes. Fast forward six days and we are now onstage playing to a packed house at Danceteria. A few numbers in and I hear a heckler yelling loudly above the music and can hear Peter giving back as good as he's getting. As Peter moved to the right, I looked for the heckler and saw a guy jostling about down the front wearing a motorcycle jacket. It was Iggy Pop! The gig continued with Iggy and Pete launching verbal missiles at each other throughout our set. Afterwards, Iggy came backstage and congratulated us on a great show! He explained that he had a driver outside, and told him he'd only be about 10 minutes, but as we were so good he decided to stay the entire set. I respectfully asked if I could take a shot of him and Peter on my new Canon camera and Iggy obliged. We exchanged some more banter and then Iggy announced that he was off to some \"dark and dangerous S&M club,\" and then disappeared into the night.

In the clip above, Earl says, “This brings me to my favorite part of every show, when I start doing new shit,” before rattling off verses from unreleased tracks in quick succession. Earl’s last album, I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside, dropped in May of 2015, less than three years after his debut Doris. He may be shortening that release gap though, with the emergence of these new records. Just yesterday, Earl’s feature on the Danny Brown album, “Really Doe” with Kendrick Lamar and Ab-Soul, dropped, while earlier this month, he let go of a new track titled “Death Whistles.” On that track, Earl shouts out Edgar the Beatmaker, an alias of King Krule, leading many people to believe Krule produced the track. And last month Earl’s Adult Swim collab with Knxwledge titled “Balance” was let loose. While the releases from Earl spread out over a wide array of projects, it is nonetheless telling that his visibility has increased in recent months, with the fact that he’s performing new material potentially indicative of something more. Peep the performance footage up above with specific lyrics audible only in bits in pieces, though Earl seems to stick to his verbally-dense verses, spouting off rhymes with measured precision. 14 Rappers With Weird First Names Image of Subscribe to XXL on Filed Under: Bangers | Earl Sweatshirt Category: News SHARE TWEET EMAIL REDDIT More Leave a comment EMAIL Print this page Pin it!

Accordingly, You hereby waive any requirement that EGSAF post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to EGSAF to enforce any provision of this TOS. TERM AND TERMINATION. This TOS will take effect the moment You click “ACCEPT”, register, respond to a request for information, and/or begin downloading, accessing, or using the Site, whichever is earliest. EGSAF reserves the right at any time and on reasonable grounds, which shall include, without limitation, any reasonable belief of fraudulent or unlawful activity or actions or omissions that violate any term or condition of this Agreement, to deny You access to the Site or to any portion thereof in order to protect its name and goodwill, its business, and/or other Users, and this TOS will also terminate automatically if You fail to comply with its terms and conditions, subject to the survival rights of certain provisions identified below. Termination will be effective without notice and may impact your membership status with EGSAF. You may also terminate this TOS at any time by ceasing to use the Site, but all applicable provisions of this TOS will survive termination, as identified below, and each re-access or use of the Site will reapply this TOS (then in effect) to You. Upon termination, You must destroy all copies of any aspect of the Site in your possession. The provisions concerning EGSAF's proprietary rights, disclaimers of warranty and liability, waiver and severability, entire agreement, and governing law will survive the termination of this TOS for any reason. WAIVER & SEVERABILITY. Failure to insist on strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of this TOS will not operate as a waiver of any subsequent default or failure of performance. No waiver by EGSAF of any right under this TOS will be deemed to be either a waiver of any other right or provision or a waiver of that same right or provision at any other time. If any part of this TOS is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and the liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most clearly matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of this TOS shall continue in effect. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. No joint venture, partnership, employment, affiliate, or agency relationship exists between You and EGSAF as result of this TOS or your utilization of the Site. This TOS and EGSAF's Privacy Policy represent the entire agreement between You and EGSAF with respect to use of the Site, and they supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written between You and EGSAF with respect to the Site. You may not assign or transfer any rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of EGSAF. Please note that EGSAF reserves the right to change the terms and conditions of this TOS by posting a revised TOS or mailing and/or e-mailing notice thereof to You. In addition, EGSAF may add, modify, or delete any aspect, program, or feature of the Site, but EGSAF is not under any obligation to add any upgrade, enhancement, or modification. Your continued use of the Site following any announced change will be conclusively deemed acceptance of any change to the terms and conditions of this TOS. Accordingly, please review the TOS found at this location on a periodic basis. You’re One Step Away From Joining Everytown Submit Thank You! Let your friends know you stand with Everytown.

Our Bassist Is Bailing Too 1 9/20/2016 9:24 AM PDT BY TMZ STAFF Breaking News And then there was one -- AC/DC bassist Cliff Williams is quitting the band ... leaving Angus Young in his knickers as the last man standing. 66-year-old Williams, who's been playing bass since 1977, announced he's tapping out from recording and touring with AC/DC once they wrap up their current world tour ... so he can chill and have some family time. The band's fallen apart in recent years -- guitarist Malcolm Young quit when he got dementia, drummer Phil Rudd ditched after a drug conviction, and lead singer Brian Johnson lost his hearing. Axl Rose has been filling in for Brian during the tour ... which is now looking like the last rodeo for the legendary rockers.   SHARE ON FACEBOOK   TWEET THIS   COMMENTS See also Axl Rose -- First Performance with AC/DC AC/DC's Brian Johnson -- Don't Bury Me Yet ...

By Jonathan Foerster | Photography by Craig Hildebrand Cover Story Go behind the scenes at the photo shoot for this story. Picturesque. Laid-back. Tropical. Blissful. Lots of adjectives get assigned to Southwest Florida. “Rockin’” isn’t one of them. And that’s exactly why the rock stars love it here. Some of the music industry’s most recognizable names have at one point or another called Lee and Collier counties home—Donna Summer, Bob Seger, Jose Feliciano, John Lodge of the Moody Blues, Rickey Medlocke of Lynyrd Skynyrd. Outside of Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson’s run-in with the law at a 2003 New Year’s Eve party at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, they haven’t brought what most people would consider the rock ’n’ roll lifestyle with them. Nope. That would be defeating the purpose of ditching the big cities and their crazy nightclubs for our little corner of the world. For the rockers who call Southwest Florida home, this place is about escaping the rigors of the road and settling into the subtropics. Meet three of our favorite rock stars/community philanthropists/neighborhood pals/ordinary guys who live among us.   Brian Howe When he’s not on tour, you can often find Brian Howe at the bar of Skye’s Restaurant, a Mexican-American hybrid joint just about a mile north of his Fort Myers Beach compound. “It’s my favorite haunt,” he says. “It’s just a nice neighborhood bar. Everyone just treats me like I’m Brian from down the street.” Except he’s not just Brian from down the street. He’s Brian Howe, former lead singer of one of the biggest super groups of the 1980s—Bad Company. He stumbled upon the island when he suddenly had some time to kill during a Florida tour swing in 1986 that got delayed. “It was Dec. 12,” he says. “I checked into the Lani Kai and absolutely fell in love with the place. I’m from England, so I’d never really seen this kind of weather in December. And there was the beach and palm trees; it was heaven. Within six months I’d made the move. I’ve been here full time ever since.” Howe believes that the area attracts older rockers because people don’t make a big deal about who they are. Most people down here have been successful at some point in their careers. “It’s just a neat lifestyle,” he says. “I’m not one for New York or LA or Chicago. This is just about relaxing in the sun and being laid-back.” Howe grew up knowing he’d be a singer. He watched his dad sing on the English club and pub circuit. But he never expected to hit the big time. From age 3 on he was entering talent contests, and usually winning. He got his big break in the early 1980s when Ted Nugent brought him on to be the lead vocalist for a new album and tour. After that, when Bad Company decided to re-form without original singer Paul Rodgers, Howe was the perfect fit. “I never expected to get this far, but I’m happy to be doing it,” he says. “I don’t ever plan to stop. I think it’s a fear of not being able to do it anymore that makes me want to go out and do it again the next day.” \"I am always thinking about the next song, not the last one.\" Now a longtime solo artist, Howe was putting the final touches on a new album, Hot Tin Roof, when he spoke to Gulfshore Life. The new tunes are what he’s most passionate about. He knows the hits pay the bills, and he says he’s “happy to sing them. How many people get to go out and sing 15 hit songs? “But I am always thinking about the next song, not the last one. The new stuff—that’s what keeps you fresh.” Howe says he records all his vocals in his house, using different rooms to get different effects. The new tracks “gave my voice a test,” he says. The rest of his time is spent enjoying his favorite time of year on the island. “This is the best because it becomes a little bit like a ghost town,” he says. “The snowbirds have gone north and now it’s just us locals.”   Steve Luongo Always a musical kid, Steve Luongo knew he wanted to be a drummer in second grade when the high school orchestra played for his elementary school. “That was my first live music experience, and the second I heard the music, when the drums started playing, I knew that’s what I wanted to do.” By the time he was in his early teens, Luongo was a professional drummer playing gigs with his high school friends in a band that became Rat Race Choir. Although unknown nationally, Rat Race Choir was one of the most popular bands in the New York City metro area for nearly two decades starting in the late 1960s. They never recorded but always had plenty of paying gigs. “From the time I was 18, we were playing 300 shows a year,” Luongo says. “We did that for 20 years. We were making $1,000 a week in the 1960s.” “It was all sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll back then,” he says. “A lot of guys went down a long, sordid, scary road. There’s a lot of people from back then that didn’t survive it. We would do 22 shows in three weeks and the manager would do anything to keep you going.” But national name recognition eluded him. Still, he’s worked as a session musician or in the touring band for John Entwistle, Billy Squier, Alan Parsons and Robin Zander, to name a few. “Plain and simple, the peaks have been as high as the valleys are low,” Luongo says of his career. “But in the end, I’ve had more success than one person could dream of.” It was after a tour with Entwistle, the former The Who bassist who would become Luongo’s best friend, that Luongo and his wife, Laurie, found Southwest Florida. “We started going to warm places with Entwistle,” he says. “After one tour, we were living in New York and just wanted to get somewhere else. So I packed up the car with my wife and dog and headed south. We ended up on Sanibel Island. And it was just nothing but solitude. We started renting a little cottage there on Turner Beach. And after a few days there, all the wounds of touring subsided.” In 2004 they ended up in a house in the Whiskey Creek area that had a pool for their aging wolfhound to swim in to help with mobility issues. “We swam every day, and he lived another six months. That’s when I decided I didn’t want to go back to New York.” Once they moved to Florida permanently, they had to assimilate into their new community quickly thanks to Hurricane Charley. As any newly minted Floridian would, Luongo panicked a bit when the storm was coming. “I was duct-taping everything and putting all my instruments up in high cabinets,” he says. “It was all sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll back then.” But the storm did very little damage to his property. “I think we lost one coconut in one tree,” he says. The next year after Hurricane Wilma came through the area, Luongo joined up with Cliff Williams and Brian Johnson from AC/DC and members of Cheap Trick, Deep Purple and more to do a benefit concert for hurricane relief. Luongo’s John Entwistle Foundation helped distribute the money after the show. Thankfully no more storms have come through since. And Luongo has settled into a life of recording music for TV, painting art for his gallery and designing his own line of men’s shirts. “I don’t think I’ve been this busy ever,” he says.   Cliff Williams Not quite 30 years old, Cliff Williams peers out from behind the mob of his band mates on the album cover of AC/DC’s Highway to Hell. In many ways that cover symbolizes Williams’ relationship to the band and to the Fort Myers area. Williams is known for his easy, no-nonsense bass lines that allowed guitarists Angus and Malcolm Young to create some of the most recognizable riffs in rock. He didn’t take the limelight, but his steady work let others thrive. Since moving to Fort Myers in the late 1980s, that’s the same role he’s played in the community. Williams and his wife, Georganne, aren’t the flashiest philanthropists. They don’t have their name on buildings. But they’ve been central to the growth of several local charities, including The Heights Foundation. But that was all a respite from life as a rock star. “Life on a tour bus, once we had graduated from a station wagon with five band members plus a roadie and our luggage and guitars,” Cliff says. “Luckily we were all little guys! “The first tour bus was an old piece of junk driven by a seriously overweight good ole boy who called himself ‘Jesse James,’ to which we added the words ‘the fat-assed’ to. He would work the CB radio and announce himself onboard along with the rock group ‘AC/DC outa England’ to anyone listening. He never did get the fact it was from Australia, but then he may have thought that was in England. “This bus life progressed for years to better buses that would not break down on your one day off to flying commercially and having your own hotel room. We lived on the road permanently in those days, with time off for recording a new album and always Christmas and New Year’s off for sanity.” The couple ended up in Lee County for the most normal-person reasons ever. They were looking for a good place on the water to raise their children and had a good recommendation from a friend. “We were in Hawaii at the time, but we were looking for a place a little more central so that I could get on tour easily,” he says. “Brian was living in Fort Myers Beach, so we knew the area a little bit. We loved being by the water, loved the beachy, easy vibe. And then we found the Canterbury School.” The Brian in that story is Brian Johnson, AC/DC’s longtime lead singer who recently left the band because of hearing problems. He has long since decamped from Lee County to Sarasota. Although the Williams’ kids probably had the best dad ever for career day at school, the rest of their lives was pretty normal by design. “We never looked at this place as anything other than home,” Williams says. “Our kids were little and going to school when we first came here. Then you make friends and you become part of the community.” Williams notes that even at the height of AC/DC’s fame in the late ’80s and early ’90s, in Fort Myers he was just another guy raising a family. And now that he’s about to retire, he’ll be just another successful guy who looks for ways to spend his time. “We never looked at this place as anything other than home.” His retirement is in part due to the changes the band has faced over the past few years. First guitarist and founding member Malcolm Young had to retire because of cancer and dementia. Then drummer Phil Rudd, who has always had a mercurial relationship with the band, was sentenced to house arrest after threatening to kill someone. And the recent departure of Johnson, replaced on tour by Axl Rose, means that most of the people he’s spent the past four decades with are no longer there. “It’s been what I’ve known for the past 40 years, but after this tour I’m backing off of touring and recording,” he says. “Losing Malcolm, the thing with Phil and now with Brian, it’s a changed animal. I feel in my gut it’s the right thing.” Williams realizes his story is the one-in-a-million tale that most aspiring rockers never get to tell. Just like the stock room boy who dreams of being the CEO. “When you start out, you kind of hope for success,” Williams says. “That’s what you are working for. But you never really know. It’s been surreal, really.”   Edit ModuleShow Tags You Might Like The Crown, the Snakepit and the Naples Graduate When shy Monique Evans became Miss Texas, she had no idea how it would change her life.

It was the mid-'90s. ODB was at the height of his success. Keith, a 19-year-old punkass kid music producer, found himself in a recording session at the Music Palace, a premiere music facility out on Long Island, with 88-Keys (yes, that 88-Keys) as his assistant. He recalls: \"Dirty rolled in with an entourage of 15 to 20, from top-level A&Rs and executives to street-level thugs. And their women.\" The crew was, per Keith, \"indulging in all the devices associated with rock 'n' roll.\" Operative word there? Devices. \"When he met me, I looked him right in the face, shook his hand, and I said, 'Peace,'\" Keith remembers. At that \"record-scratch moment,\" ODB narrowed his eyes. \"[Dirty] looked at me like I was crazy—for like two seconds—and then he was like 'Oh, that's the god right there. He greeted me with the universal greeting: 'Peace.' What can I say to that but peace?' \" ODB went on to get \"wild\" that night, and they recorded \"Dirt Dog,\" which eventually appeared on Dirt's Nigga Please. The producer chuckles as he tells this story. It's one of the many tales he's gathered over the past two decades, a time during which the 36-year-old has quietly become an influential force in the music industry. On Sunday, he'll attend the Grammys with two nominations as a producer and engineer for Frank Ocean's channel ORANGE. Keith also just released his debut album City Pulse online, for free. His influence on Ocean is apparent: Both records offer stitched-together, smoothed-out r&b that illustrates emotion in a tangible way. Keith candidly chats over the phone from his Hollywood recording studio, but the story of Om'Mas Keith isn't a West Coast one: It starts—and probably will end—in New York City.

His mother called him a \"magical jazz baby.\" Then, around the age of 15, he met one of his heroes: Jam Master Jay, the groundbreaking, influential DJ of Run DMC. Keith squeaked his way under Jay's wing and became his \"young ace.\" He saw \"how a soon-to-be-inducted-to-the-Rock-and-Roll-Hall-of-Fame-peon conducts his business at home.\" He made a beat for Ultramagnetic MCs. They loved it, flew him to L.A., and he got picked up at the airport by a Bentley Continental driven by Ice-T. The group recorded music at Ice-T's famous Crackhouse studio over three weeks, where he met Shafiq Husayn (with whom he'd later form the hip-hop group Sa-Ra). The first night in Los Angeles, he slept on rapper Kool Keith's floor without a blanket near a stack of very expensive pornos that reached the ceiling. \"Three weeks of the biggest mind-fuck ever,\" Keith recalls. \"[Ice-T] was my first multimillionaire. Jay was rich to me, but we were in Queens. This was L.A.\" That whirlwind gave Keith a taste of the life he could one day live, and he went back to New York with success fresh on the brain. He pushed more with Jay, ODB, Busta Rhymes. He traveled to Houston to work with famous Suave House producer Tony Draper. He moved back east, made beats, worked for an ad firm, but again felt the tug of the west, and went back to L.A. It was a smart move. He partnered with Shafiq and Taz Arnold, forming Sa-Ra and racking up production credits for the likes of Jurassic 5 and Pharoahe Monch. Kanye West signed them to G.O.O.D. Music, and Keith has been sought after ever since. In 2009, through his intern Michael Uzowuru, he met a little hip-hop collective called Odd Future and a dude named Frank Ocean. The two developed a relationship that would eventually lead to Keith's work on channel ORANGE. Keith was thrilled and, in another smart move, threw himself into the work with Ocean, putting his solo project on hold. \"Frank's understanding of what a producer does is true to what it really is, that a producer ensures the physical manifestation of intellectual property,\" Keith says. \"However we arrive at the final goal, whether it be by me playing instruments, adding things, adding insight, talking to Frank, or supervising every single occurrence of his voice on the record: This is producing on the high level. This is my opportunity to produce on the Quincy Jones level.\" In the wake of ORANGE's success and critical acclaim, his opportunities to work at Q's level continue. He's assisting with rapper Azealia Banks's forthcoming record and Ocean's next album, and is in talks with Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt for their joint debut—all while readying for the response to City Pulse. \"All I wanted to do when I started this game was make great music and create and have an outlet,\" he says. \"But they chose me. All these kids, everybody chose me. So when someone does that, you have to really say to yourself: 'I have to be the best I can be for them, to ensure that the final result is what's in their head.' That's what's being a service provider. That's Om'Mas Keith at your service.\" esundermann@villagevoice.com @ericsundy Contact: Eric Sundermann Follow: Village Voice Music Village Voice Music Music Music News Get the Music Newsletter Keep your thumb on the local music scene each week with music news, trends, artist interviews and concert listings.

Credit: Brian Ach/Getty By David Browne 2 hours ago More News Minnesota Vikings Pay Tribute to Prince With Halftime Show Watch Sting Debut Bowie, Prince-Inspired Song '50,000' Prince Tribute Enlists Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera All Stories » On October 6th, nearly six months after Prince's death from an accidental overdose of the opioid fentanyl, his fabled Paisley Park compound in Chanhassen, Minnesota, will open its doors for public tours. In preparation, workers digging through its rooms have found an array of treasures: from vintage outfits (including the one he wore at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2007) to a book with 40 to 50 pages of handwritten lyrics and a secret room that hid unreleased video footage.  Related Inside Prince's Final Days He was an electrifying performer to the end – but his controlled superstar life also hid many red flags \"Everywhere I turn,\" a source close to the project tells Rolling Stone, \"it's, 'Holy crap.'\" Even more surprising are the detailed guidelines Prince left behind for turning Paisley Park into a museum after his death – including a wall-mounted timeline of his life through the mid-1990s and messages and texts sent to friends that specify how he wanted fans to walk through Paisley Park. \"We're seeing e-mails he sent four months before his death that say how he wanted it,\" says the source. \"He wasn't foreshadowing anything. [But] he always wanted his fans to come here. He left us a big road map.\" Unfortunately, the museum is about the only aspect of Prince's affairs that has a road map. His estate has become a tangle of legitimate and dubious heirs, daunting financial burdens and tough questions over who should have a say in shaping his legacy. A perfect example of the chaos was seen in the planning for the official Prince tribute concert, currently scheduled for October 13th at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. Originally set for August at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, the show was postponed several times and an early promoter dropped out at the last minute. Just when it seemed that the concert might not take place, a lineup – featuring Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Chaka Khan, John Mayer, Morris Day and the Time, and members of the New Power Generation – was rolled out less than a month before the show. The soundstage at Paisley Park. Kevin Mazur/Getty The issue of who controls Prince's assets is even messier. Since he left no will and had no known children, his estate will be split among his sister, Tyka, and his half-siblings Sharon, Norrine, John Nelson, Alfred Jackson and Omarr Baker. \"I don't think Prince was too concerned about these earthly concerns we have,\" says Frank Wheaton, Jackson's attorney.  Yet more than two dozen people filed affidavits of heirship, including a woman who claims she secretly married Prince in 2002. She was unable to produce either the wedding certificate or a secret will she claims to possess because \"the CIA and other agencies consider both documents to be top-secret,\" according to court papers. As Judge Kevin Eide said during one hearing, \"In many ways, we are in uncharted water here.\" Most of those claims have been thrown out by the court. Prince's family now faces a daunting estate-tax bill that will come due in January, based on the value of his recorded work and real estate. Some have estimated his assets at as much as $300 million, and Prince's estate may owe as much as half that amount. \"We're seeing e-mails he sent four months before his death that say how he wanted [Paisley Park to look],\" says one source. One surefire revenue generator will be Prince's music. To temporarily help manage his assets, Bremer Trust – the Minnesota bank and investment firm chosen by a court to serve as special administrator for Prince's estate – appointed two industry veterans: L. Londell McMillan, who once served as Prince's lawyer, and longtime executive Charles Koppelman, who brokered the deal for Prince's 1996 album Emancipation. According to McMillan, a possible hits package could be released by year's end.  Even more valuable, potentially, is the massive amount of unreleased music and video in his vault at Paisley Park. McMillan says fans should expect to hear some of that material next year. \"We're still doing inventory, and we're still mourning,\" he says. \"I know the world wants to commercialize it, but we're still getting through the stuff.\" One source has estimated that the vault contains \"thousands upon thousands\" of tapes, but as of press time, no Prince associate had been put in charge of sifting through the material. Bremer Trust contacted Susan Rogers, Prince's engineer for much of the 1980s, who tells Rolling Stone she's willing to play an advisory role but nothing has been nailed down yet. \"We need to approach this with love and care and a high moral compass,\" Rogers says. \"Some of his fans have written to me and begged that his material not be altered in any way.\" Among the gems Rogers would love to see released are a version of \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" with Prince singing lead, and the 1982 outtake \"Moonbeam Levels,\" which she calls \"poignant and revealing, which is probably why it was both valuable and risky for him.\" Paisley Park's 12,400-square-foot soundstage and the more intimate nightclub next to it will eventually host live performances. A source close to the family members says they initially weren't happy with the decision to appoint McMillan and Koppelman. Sources say the family members would prefer others who worked more closely with Prince in recent years, such as Trevor Guy, who ran Prince's NPG label. To the family's surprise, Koppelman told the New York Post that he thought the unreleased songs in Prince's vault could be turned into a Broadway musical.  For now, Prince's family is focusing on opening Paisley Park to the public. The compound will be managed and overseen by Graceland Holdings, the same group that runs Elvis Presley's famous home. The company approached Prince's family over the summer and invested several million dollars. Fans touring the facility will only have access to the first floor; they won't be able to see the basement vault, the elevator where Prince was found dead or his private apartment on the second floor. Yet there will still be plenty to experience: More than 12 rooms will be decorated thematically, each documenting a particular era of Prince's career, down to period costumes, instruments and unreleased concert footage. The recording studios will remain active, and, eventually, Paisley Park's 12,400-square-foot soundstage and the more intimate nightclub next to it will host live performances by acts yet to be named. The legendary dove cages in the lobby will also remain, as will the original carpet Prince walked on. For the family, who approve of the plans, the idea is to keep Paisley Park operating as if Prince were still alive. \"We don't want the place to be known as something that's a memory or is dead,\" says Baker. \"As long as Paisley Park is kept alive, my brother is kept alive.\" More News Minnesota Vikings Pay Tribute to Prince With Halftime Show Watch Sting Debut Bowie, Prince-Inspired Song '50,000' Prince Tribute Enlists Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera All Stories » Don’t Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Dear America, There is an issue that needs to be addressed in this country. An issue that cuts across race, class and region. At the root of it all is the easy access to guns that affects small towns and big cities, that touches us here in New York as much as Aurora, Colorado and has increased the mortality rate in places such as Chicago, Milwaukee, Cleveland and Baton Rouge. Let’s put a name to the numbers. Hadiya Pendleton was a 15-year-old Chicago high schooler who was shot and killed on a playground just a week after marching in President Barack Obama’s second inaugural parade. She was a bright light in a city too often dogged by ominous darkness. Her death inspired her friends and family to wear orange to remember her life, the color hunters wear in the woods to protect themselves and others. During our 9th annual Roots Picnic, we at Okayplayer partnered up with Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization that helped lead a coalition to take what started on the South Side of Chicago into a national movement. America, you and your citizens are actively working together to end gun violence, build safer communities and educate the masses on why common-sense steps are necessary in this country. To show how serious we are about strengthening the gun laws in this country, we invited the stars, musicians and celebrities who made our Roots Picnic in Philadelphia to join us in the fight to end gun violence in America. People like Jada Pinkett-Smith, her daughter Willow Smith, our own First Look Friday subjects Chloe x Halle and our fearless leader, Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson have all signed on to lend their voices and platforms to join the fight. It shouldn’t take the death of Hadiya Pendleton or any of the tens of thousands of people who die from gun violence each year to spark the changes that we are pushing for today. According to Everytown, 51 women are shot to death by intimate partners in an act of domestic violence in an average month. Seven children and teens are killed daily with guns in the U.S. These are more than enough reasons to call for gun reform, yet we already know that Washington gun lobbyists and the NRA are betting against change. We believe our collective voices can still be stronger than the dollars spent in silencing them. We and the special individuals represented in this gallery are challenging you, America, to wear orange in tribute to Hadiya Pendleton’s life and raise awareness and to join the nonprofit’s campaign to speak out against gun violence. Just take a look at the sea of faces in our slideshow above and see how they are representative of more than 3 million other Americans who are working together to end gun violence. This is an Everytown issue, an Every-American issue.

Adult Swim Shows Games Streams Top 10 Schedule Music Boards Toonami Keith Crofford Share this Page: Facebook Twitter Space Ghost Coast to Coast  = Requires a cable provider login Season 1 EP 1 Spanish Translation After declaring his fondness for Mexican food, Space Ghost asks diet guru Susan Powter what super powers help \"stop the insanity.\" Comedian Kevin Meaney discusses the virtues of wearing tight pants and the Bee Gees stop by for a short, bizarre visit. EP 2 Gilligan Three stranded castaways, Bob Denver (Gilligan), Dawn Wells (Mary Ann) and Russell Johnson (the Professor), take their turns in the video monitor. Zorak declares, \"I am the lone locust of the apocalypse. Think of me when you look to the night sky.\" EP 3 Elevator Self-proclaimed goddess of the galaxy Judy Tenuta and Space Ghost decide to visit the Elvis Chapel in Las Vegas. Space Ghost also talks with Dr. Timothy Leary, a man branded by Nixon as \"the most dangerous man alive.\" Then, it's tacos for everybody, even actress Ashley Judd. EP 4 CHiPs Space Ghost welcomes two talk-show experts, Bill Carter and Joe Franklin. Carter, author of \"The Late Shift,\"explains why Space Ghost was excluded from his book. Franklin, the world's first TV talk show host, gives him a few pointers. Moltar introduces his fascination with the television series \"CHiPs,\"a theme that will resurface again and again. EP 5 Bobcat During an otherwise friendly interview with comedian Bobcat Goldthwait, Zorak reveals Space Ghost's secret identity: Tad Ghostal. Goldthwait agrees to party with Space Ghost after the show. The festivities are spoiled, however, by Zorak and his punk friends, The Ramones. EP 6 Punch After model Cyndi Guyer, the female Fabio, explains what she looks for in a man, the Jerky Boys arrive and promptly threaten to punch Space Ghost in the mouth. The undertow of violence subsides with the appearance of model Dian Parkinson. EP 7 Banjo Space Ghost is nurturing a special pet—Banjo the sea monkey. Zorak sabotages the interview with Schooly D by hypnotically controlling Space Ghost's mind. Weird Al Yankovic reveals that he can eat his weight in Ding Dongs, but his interview is cut short by Banjo, now a colossal brine shrimp intent on destroying the set. EP 8 Batmantis A mysterious villain kidnaps Moltar and Space Ghost must solicit the help of Adam West, Lee Meriweather and Eartha Kitt, all from the \"Batman\"television series, in an effort to save him. And...holy exoskeleton, Space Ghost, it's Zorak as Batmantis! EP 9 Self Help Hoping to rehabilitate Zorak, Space Ghost welcomes psychiatrist Dr. Joyce Brothers, who ends up being more concerned about him. Later, comic Rich Hall give Space Ghost pointers on how to pick up women that are immediately used by Zorak and Moltar to impress author Anka Radakovich. EP 10 Gum, Disease The rapport between Branford Marsalis and Space Ghost makes it look as though the then-band leader of \"The Tonight Show\"might be switching talk shows. Next, a child star from the same television era as Space Ghost, Danny Bonaduce, talks about his days with the Partridge family and his deep-seated hatred for Osmonds. Season 2 EP 1 President's Day Nightmare Space Ghost shows off his versatility by emceeing Cartoon Network's \"World Premiere Toon In\". Members of the Council of Doom appear as judges in a beauty pageant-style competition between five cartoon directors. Blip also makes an appearance, prompting Space Ghost to croon, \"Oh, what a monkey he is!\" EP 2 Le Livre d'Histoire \"Le Livre d'Histoire\" is the electronic marriage of \"The Mask\" and \"Story Book\" with the addition of Lokar as host. \"The Mask\" was created as a trailer for the New Line Home Video Release of \"The Mask,\" starring Jim Carrey. It features Carrey's hilarious impersonation of a mantis. EP 3 Girlie Show Space Ghost pays tribute to \"Women in the Entertainment Industry.\"First, actress Fran Drescher paralyzes Space Ghost with desire. Carol Channing dispenses motherly advice to soothe his troubled heart, but this comfort is ruined by the appearance of rocker Alice Cooper, who Space Ghost has mistaken for a woman. EP 4 Hungry Space Ghost welcomes shiny happy Michael Stipe from R.E.M. (Space Ghost: \"Is that you in the corner?\"Stipe: \"Yes, it is.\") Later, he shares time-honored difficult-places-to-reach-while-scratching-stories with Lassie. Mujibur and Sirajul, frequent guest stars on \"The Late Show with David Letterman,\"mysteriously appear with Space Ghost's pizza. EP 5 Fire Drill David Byrne of the Talking Heads makes a striking revelation to Space Ghost: \"I would like to be cute and blonde. \"Later, Space Ghost attempts to get to the root of the feud between former teen idols Donny Osmond and earlier guest Danny Bonaduce. EP 6 Sleeper Feeling a little wired, Space Ghost asks professional wrestler Hulk Hogan to put him in a sleeper hold so that he can get some rest. Instead, Hogan recites an original haiku about Zorak. Slash from Guns 'N' Roses winds up the show with his usual gift for gab. EP 7 Jerk In his quest for one award-winning show, Space Ghost adds a few new twists: a live studio audience (full of Zorak's relatives), a remarkably versatile applause sign and viewer call-in. The results fall flat and Space Ghost isn't happy. In fact, guests Palmer Mills and Sandra Bernhard come to agree that Space Ghost is a real jerk. EP 8 Urges It's mating season on Zorak's home planet. Despite the rather unpleasant role the male plays in the mantis love ritual, Zorak gives in to that most common of insect impulses and returns home. Meanwhile, Space Ghost welcomes giggly actress Catherine Bach and plays the blues with musician Matthew Sweet. Season 3 EP 1 Explode Lokar, a villain from Space Ghost's original series, attempts to woo Moltar away from his helm as director. Oblivious, Space Ghost proceeds with his celebrity guests--Terry Jones and Glen Phillips--one of whom reveals his secret identity as Tongue Man. EP 2 $20.01 This loose parody of Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" features Joel Hodgson, creator of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000,\" and comedic magicians Penn and Teller. Moltar and Zorak are fired when Space Ghost replaces them with MOE 2000, an unfeeling computer director. EP 3 Lovesick Debuting on Valentine's Day, this episode finds Space Ghost heartbroken over a failed relationship. The despondent Ghost finds that not even the antics of comedian Carrot Top can lure him from his lovesick stupor. EP 4 Transcript Musician Jonathan Richman, who first climbed to fame fronting The Modern Lovers, favors Space Ghost with a couple of charming songs during a meandering conversation. EP 5 Sharrock Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore stars as Fred Cracklin in a 15-minute showcase for late musician Sonny Sharrock. Sharrock was the man behind the \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" theme music. EP 6 Boo! Space Ghost turns to experts for advice on supernatural phenomena such as the disappearance of his phantom cruiser keys. Guests Michael Norman, ghost expert and author of \"Historic Haunted America,\" and Bill Nye of \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\" are all too happy to help him out. EP 7 Freak Show Marshall \"Duh\" Staxx of the musical group Green Jelly and yodeller Wylie Gustafson are the freaks du jour in this aptly named episode. The show also features a video pirate who identifies himself only as \"Commander Andy of the Cosmos.\" EP 8 Switcheroo Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! EP 9 Surprise After Moltar sends Space Ghost away to \"pick up an important package in the mailroom,\" Zorak takes a seat behind the desk. What happens next is television history as Zorak cackles through a rapid-fire series of \"interviews\" with everyone from actress Cameron Diaz to TV's Jimmie \"Good Times\" Walker. EP 10 Glen Campbell Moltar puts the show on \"automated technical direction\" and disappears in accordance with a manual he's reading entitled \"The Joy of Escape.\" Space Ghost, meanwhile, welcomes Matt Groening, creator and executive producer of television's \"The Simpsons.\" EP 11 Jacksonville With Moltar on the run, suspense dominates this episode, from its Martin Quinn Production open to its \"Charlie's Angels\"-inspired cutaways and faux-spy drama epilogue. Space Ghost is forced to recruit Tansut as his fill-in director, who causes problems before bringing out guests Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield of Metallica. EP 12 Late Show Former \"Late Show With David Letterman\" writers scripted this unabashed spoof of late-night talk show convention. Janeane Garofalo reveals her secret power, then hypnotist Flip Orley joins Space Ghost until Zorak, using an incantation, turns him into David Grohl of the Foo Fighters. Sitting in with the band is John Popper of Blues Traveler. EP 13 Cookout After a show open that features Moltar and Zorak arguing the respective merits of Beefaroni and Beefaghetti, Space Ghost enlists the Council of Doom to judge an old-fashioned cooking competition between three nationally-acclaimed culinary experts: Emeril Lagasse, Nathalie Dupree and Martin Yan. EP 14 Art Show Performance artist Laurie Anderson riles Space Ghost by revealing that she never watches television, then waxes conspiratorial about cyberspace. A disengaged Space Ghost invisos out, missing much of their remaining conversation. Next, Space Ghost endeavors to understand members of the performance troupe Stomp. EP 15 Woody Allen's Fall Project In an apparent tribute to E! Entertainment's well-publicized re-enactments of the O.J. Simpson hearings, viewers are treated to performances of selected \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" moments by the Ghost Planet Dinner Theater Ensemble of Doraville, GA. Season 4 EP 1 Rehearsal This flashback episode transports viewers to a dress rehearsal two days before the premiere of \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" in April 1994. Offering a rare glimpse behind the scenes, \"Rehearsal\" features Space Ghost, Moltar and Zorak flubbing familiar gags, missing cues and mistiming special effects. EP 2 Gallagher Space Ghost introduces \"Space Time Quiz Fun 9000\" and his \"contestants,\" comedians David Cross and Bob Odenkirk of HBO's \"Mr. Show.\" What follows is a rapid-fire conversation in more ways than one, as Odenkirk's growing addiction to power-band blasts results in a steady volley from Space Ghost. EP 3 Edelweiss Zorak is zapped until he can apparently no longer regenerate, leaving Space Ghost without a bandleader. Moltar is instructed to fill in for his dearly departed friend by singing renditions of German folk songs, which puts Beck, the show's lone guest, to sleep. EP 4 Anniversary Space Ghost marks a \"special notch in the belt that is the Space Ghost saga\" with returning guests Bobcat Goldthwait and Judy Tenuda. The show also includes special appearances by villian-turned-announcer Tansut and the evil Chad Ghostal, as well as a spectacular career retrospective montage compiled by Moltar. EP 5 Zoltran Space Ghost chats with Robin Leach until his guest reveals that he is, in fact, an evil villain named Zoltran. Leach, as Zoltran, blasts Space Ghost by shooting lasers out of his eyes. Unfortunately for Space Ghost, the show doesn't get any easier as Merrill Markoe needles him about his age and his intergalactic location. EP 6 Pilot After revealing that contractual squabbles before the premiere of \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" resulted in an aborted test shoot starring rival superhero Birdman, host Lokar presents exclusive glimpses of this \"lost\" pilot. EP 7 Speck Reggae star Jimmy Cliff chats with Space Ghost about his new album and touring in South America. Moltar and mechanic-turned-musician Jack Logan share a creepy conversation about items underneath their beds. An irritating speck in Space Ghost's eye stops the show cold, a final calamity on a night of amusing mishaps. EP 8 Zorak Space Ghost presents a special tribute to Zorak. Dr. Maxcy Nolan, professor of entomology at the University of Georgia, speculates that the bandleader may be hiding an extra set of legs under his vest. Exterminator Steve Arnold, meanwhile, reveals that he says \"Take this!\" before going after insects. EP 9 Switcheroo '97 Space Ghost's two sidekicks have hosted a science-fiction convention behind his back. Moltar and Zorak bring out their own guests--Bill Mumy (Will Robinson of \"Lost in Space\") and Mark Hamill. In a jealous rage, Space Ghost announces plans for \"Space Ghost Con '97,\" vowing to exclude his co-stars. EP 10 Mayonnaise While attempting to introduce Jon Stewart to the wonders of aroma therapy--\"picture a camel, if you will, traipsing across the desert sands\"--Moltar accidentally cuts off his oxygen. Stewart is revived to chat with Space Ghost about talk shows. Advice from Mike Douglas leads to an inspired musical ending. EP 11 Brilliant Number One Space Ghost pays homage to his real boss by continually referring to Peter Fonda as \"Ted Turner's brother-in-law.\" Fonda demands to have eyes drawn on Space Ghost, causing blindness for our superhero host. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin also appears and admits that he has only landed on the moon... and not Ghost Planet. EP 12 Boo Boo Kitty Self-heralded \"comedy ghetto\" resident Michael McKean barely gets a word in with Space Ghost, and David Lander suffers a similar fate. The reason? Zorak and Space Ghost's roommate tiff spilling over into the show. In addition, a menacing \"kitty\" blimp hovers around Ghost Planet. EP 13 Needledrop Even though two prominent rappers, Ice-T and Ernie-C, make their \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" debut, Space Ghost decides to do the \"hip shake\" throughout the show. Zorak attempts to hypnotize all the guests, including actor Fred Willard. EP 14 Sphinx \"Beavis and Butthead\" and \"King of the Hill\" creator Mike Judge kindly asks Space Ghost to \"whack the Rugrats.\" Space Ghost agrees to the job, as long as he can get onto one of Judge's shows. Harland Williams doesn't last long after calling Space Ghost \"Billy\" and \"Naughty Space Ghost.\" EP 15 Pavement Indie rock group Pavement, sitting in for an incarcerated Zorak and The Original Way-Outs, makes history as the first band ever to perform on \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast.\" Goldie Hawn, Tommy Davidson, Red Green and Colin Quinn also appear in an episode scripted by Space Ghost himself. EP 16 Untitled Space Ghost, an unofficial member of the P-Funk Mob, sets the groove in motion with George Clinton, but Moltar attempts to wrest the show from Space Ghost's control so he can interview his hero and the star of TV's \"CHiPs,\" Erik Estrada. EP 17 Hipster Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! EP 18 Piledriver Grandpa Space Ghost, whose physique is identical to his grandson's and whose voice is identical to WCW wrestler \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, gives an \"OOOO-YEEAAAHHH!\" performance despite being clubbed with a chair by Zorak. Grandpa Ghostal interviews kid actress Raven Symone. EP 19 Suckup Desperate for a new gig, Space Ghost kisses up to \"Talk Soup\" host John Henson and \"Entertainment Tonight\" host Bob Goen by telling each that they are \"pretty men.\" Space Ghost even offers to set Henson up with his \"sister\" Judy. Brak spoils the affair by spilling gravy all over the set. EP 20 Dam \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" welcomes its first-ever Academy Award-winner, Charlton Heston, who, after much prodding, offers his trophy to Space Ghost. Rumor has it that Heston tells an interesting \"Planet of the Apes\" story, but Zorak and Moltar decide to screech over the actor's voice. EP 21 Boat Show The deep space set comes alive like never before with 11 glorious musical numbers. Space Ghost, Zorak and Moltar are joined by Brak, who performs a melodic \"Man on the Street\" duet with the originator of the popular skit, Steve Allen. Andy Dick and Space Ghost display a remarkable chemistry in their inspiring rendition of \"Clickety Click.\" EP 22 Telethon When the \"Council of Doom\" takes your phone calls and the only caller is Brak posing as \"Seymour Hiney,\" you know your telethon is in trouble. Of course, it takes Space Ghost until the telethon's disappointing ending to realize his show is completely bankrupt... for good! EP 23 Dimethyl Pyrimidinol Bisulfite Space Ghost and Zorak try to endorse ointment and potted meat to the home viewing audience. Pat Boone sings Space Ghost's praises, while rapper Chuck D is not impressed with the public-service rap performance by the Rappin' Space Goblin. Season 5 EP 1 Joshua Two winners of the \"Haikuin' for Space Ghost\" contest, which challenged viewers to write a haiku, join legendary crooner Tony Bennett and comedian Tom Arnold in a season finale. The episode also features a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the show, as well as an infomercial for business execs around the globe. EP 2 Terminal Space Ghost announces that he is dying and begins to look for someone to replace him. To confirm the grim prognosis, Dr. Drew Pinsky appears on the show. Believing that Space Ghost's death is forthcoming, Zorak becomes excited and begins playing New Orleans jazz, which gets him zapped. EP 3 Toast After Space Ghost declares his love for Merill Markoe, he receives advice from Adam Corolla, host of MTV's \"Loveline.\" Knowing that Space Ghost is smitten, Zorak begins to do everything in his power to win Merrill Markoe as his own, leading to a battle between the two. EP 4 Lawsuit Space Ghost is the target of a lawsuit filed against him by former co-stars Jan and Jace. The twins employ the services of the infamous Dr. Nightmare to represent their case. In an effort to defend himself, Space Ghost acquires attorney Greta Van Susteren. EP 5 Cahill A vicious storm on Ghost Planet has Space Ghost scared silly. Moltar chats with meteorologist Mark McEwen about the weather pattern. Also appearing is Garrett Morris. EP 6 Warren Space Ghost grows angry upon learning that he has been \"imposternated\" on a bizarre, intergalactic television program called \"The Warren Show.\" In response, he takes Moltar and Zorak on a mission to find the host, who is actually a bush. EP 7 Chinatown Supermodel Tyra Banks guests on an episode that features Space Ghost trading Moltar to a Japanese baseball team. Moltar is replaced in the control room by a dog and has a song dedicated to him by Zorak. EP 8 Rio Ghosto Pursuing a movie career, Space Ghost seeks advice from the director of \"Mallrats,\" Kevin Smith, and actor Ben Stiller. Hollywood director Jim Jarmusch also makes an appearance. EP 9 Pal Joey Joey, an overzealous ex-intern, annoys Space Ghost with his antics. In retribution, Space Ghost destroys the pest and shuttles his corpse into outer space for disposal. EP 10 Curses Space Ghost is afflicted by the Curse of Kintave and is driven to eat all of his guests. In the end, even Zorak and Moltar cannot escape his ravenous appetite. The svelte Shirley Manson is spared, since she's not much of a meal. EP 11 Intense Patriotism Space Ghost attempts to take Ghost Planet to the United States, and consequently focuses the show on various aspects of America. Zorak fools Space Ghost into thinking that his mantis droppings are his children. The crew finally ends up in Tijuana, trying to get over the border. EP 12 Waiting for Edward Space Ghost interviews Denis Leary with questions like, \"Are you a leprechaun?\" Moltar destroys Ghost Planet and Space Ghost subsequently appears at a day camp, explaining how he saved Christmas. Season 6 EP 1 Chambraigne Space Ghost's obsession with hair care products finally gets him into trouble when he lathers up with Chambraigne, the shampoo for your brain. Despite limb loss, Space Ghost tries to convince Bob Costas and the world that Chambraigne truly is an intelli-hancer. Then Carl explodes. EP 2 Snatch The comedy stakes are high when Space Ghost, Moltar, Zorak and guest Steven Wright are stalked by body-snatching pods. Show producers auctioned off the ending of this episode on eBay. EP 3 Girl Hair Girl hair. Hanson has it and Space Ghost is obsessed with combing it. This episode reveals Space Ghost's dark side as well as Zorak's desire to procure teeth so that he can get into clubs. Appearances by the Tooth Fairy and Santa bring about one of the weirdest scenes yet staged on the show. EP 4 Sequel In this sequel to \"Lawsuit,\" Space Ghost has been sent to the slammer for years of mistreating Jan and Jace.

Examples of the types of information that may be collected include the following, depending on the particular Adobe Marketing Cloud solution and the jurisdiction of the company: Where you go and what you do on that company's websites, apps, or social media pages Your web browsing activity, including the URLs of the company’s web pages you visit The URL of the page that displayed the link that you clicked on, which brought you to that company's website The web search you performed that led you to that company's website Information about your web browser and device, such as device type, browser type, advertising identifier, operating system, connection speed, and display settings Your IP address (or partial IP address, depending on how the company has configured the solution), which may be used to approximate your general location Location information from your mobile device or web browser Social network profile information Information you may provide on that company's website, app, or when interacting with that company’s social media pages, such as information you provide on registration forms Ad campaign success rates, such as whether you clicked on a company's ad and whether viewing or clicking on the ad led to your purchase of that company's product Items you've purchased or placed in your shopping cart on that company's website or app   How do companies use Adobe Marketing Cloud to collect information? Cookies and Similar Technologies. Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons (also known as tags or pixels), to enable companies to collect information in connection with their websites. If you look at your cookie settings in your browser, you may notice cookies from Adobe-owned domains, such as omtrdc.net and demdex.net. Most Internet browsers classify these as \"third-party cookies” because they are not set by the website you are visiting. Companies using the Adobe Marketing Cloud sometimes choose to use their own cookies (often called \"first-party cookies”). Mobile. A company may also use Adobe Marketing Cloud technologies within its mobile apps. These technologies allow the company to send information to its Adobe Marketing Cloud account -- for example, how you use the company’s mobile apps as well as other information your mobile device may make available to apps, such as location information. For more information, please review the privacy policy of the company as well as privacy information provided by your mobile device manufacturer. Social Media. When you use a company’s social media pages, the social media site you visit (on which the page is located) may allow the company to send certain information about you to its Adobe Marketing Cloud account. Most social media sites allow you to configure your settings regarding how your information is used. For more information, please refer to the privacy policies of the social media sites you use.   What privacy choices do you have about a company's use of Adobe's Marketing Cloud solutions? For more information about how a company uses Adobe’s Marketing Cloud solutions, please refer to that company's privacy policy. Adobe asks its business customers to provide privacy policies describing: Their privacy practices in connection with Adobe Marketing Cloud How you can opt out of the collection or use of information gathered by the company in connection with Adobe Marketing Cloud Cookies and Similar Technologies. Adobe's Marketing Cloud uses cookies and similar technologies to enable companies to collect information. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to block all cookies, or to block only those set by companies other than the one whose website you are visiting. If you configure your browser to block cookies, you may prevent a company from collecting information using Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions on its websites. Please see Your Privacy Choices to learn more about your choices for opting out of companies’ use of Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. Mobile. Most mobile devices allow you to the limit use of mobile advertising identifiers for interest-based advertising. For more information, please review the instructions provided by your mobile device manufacturer. The Digital Advertising Alliance’s AppChoices app may also provide you with more options to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising within mobile apps. Please see Your Privacy Choices to learn more about your choices for opting out of companies’ use of Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. Email and Text Messages. To learn more about how to opt out from commercial email or text messages sent by a company using Adobe Marketing Cloud, please follow the opt out process specified within the message itself, or review the company’s privacy policy. To opt out from receiving mobile push notifications, please review the information provided by your mobile device manufacturer. Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op. The Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op is a data co-operative that enables participating Adobe Marketing Cloud companies to better recognize their consumers across devices. Each participating company provides the Co-op with technical information, such as cryptographically hashed login IDs and HTTP header information, about its consumers. But no personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or phone number is shared with the Co-op.  The Co-op then combines and processes the technical information to recognize when multiple devices are used by the same individual (who is not personally identifiable by the Co-op), and creates links among those devices. These device links are used by participating companies to link devices they have already seen visit their sites or advertising, and to provide consistent experiences and marketing activities across the devices. You can learn more about how the Co-op works or opt-out. Interest-Based Advertising. Adobe is a member of the following interest-based advertising self-regulatory groups: Australian Digital Advertising Alliance (ADAA) Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Adobe complies with the member requirements of these groups, including the NAI Code of Conduct and other applicable NAI guidance. Please visit these groups' sites for more information about interest-based advertising, including how to opt out of companies' use of Adobe Marketing Cloud advertising solutions. Please also see Your Privacy Choices to learn more about your choices for opting out of companies’ use of Adobe Marketing Cloud advertising solutions. If you opt out, you will no longer receive interest-based ads using Adobe Marketing Cloud advertising solutions that are based on your previous activity on websites. You may still receive ads from companies that use our advertising solutions, but they will no longer be based on your previous web browsing or likely interests. When you opt out, Adobe will place at least one opt out cookie on your browser. If you delete your cookies, change browsers, or change devices, you will need to repeat this opt-out process. Also, please note that this opt-out process will work only if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies.   How long is information collected on behalf of companies using Adobe Marketing Cloud advertising solutions retained? As described above, the Adobe Marketing Cloud advertising solutions use cookies and similar technologies, and mobile technologies, to help companies collect information about how you use their websites and apps so they can provide you with more relevant ads. These ads are often called “interest-based ads.” Adobe generally retains this information within the Adobe Marketing Cloud advertising services for a maximum of 37 months from the time it was collected. The companies that use the Adobe Marketing Cloud advertising services may use Adobe’s technologies to collect data, or, as explained below, add additional information to the information they collect using the Adobe Marketing Cloud. In these situations, Adobe retains data in accordance with the company’s instructions.     What information can a company upload to Adobe Marketing Cloud? Some of the Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions are designed to enable a company to upload information into its Adobe Marketing Cloud account. Therefore, companies sometimes upload information that they have collected from their own websites, apps, social media pages, or from other sources, such as third party data providers.     Does Adobe share any of the information its business customers collect using Adobe Marketing Cloud? Adobe does not share its business customers’ information except as described in the Adobe Privacy Policy, in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op, or when asked to do so by the business customer. Please review the privacy policy of the company using Adobe Marketing Cloud for more information about that company's privacy practices. Companies often allow Adobe to aggregate their data in a way that does not identify individuals for the purpose of publishing reports, such as the Adobe Digital Index.

His debut EP is an dazzling celebration of rubbery West Coast basslines, Southern street twang, and the cheerful bounce of Chi-Town prodigies like Kanye and Chance. While his peers preoccupy themselves with trends, James is getting high off his own hyperactive musical imagination.

The fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline encompasses everything from the federal government’s historically appalling treatment of Native Americans to broader debates over fracking and climate change. The cause has attracted a vast array of tribes, activists, and environmentalists from across the country, and tensions have soared. On September 3, private security for the company building the pipeline used dogs and pepper spray on protesters trying to block bulldozers. Opponents have taken the fight to court, hoping to alter or block the project. The DC Circuit Court is currently hearing a major legal challenge to the pipeline, with the Standing Rock Sioux arguing that the Army Corps of Engineers did not properly consult them before greenlighting the section near their reservation. In the meantime, construction is grinding to a halt: On Friday, September 9, a federal judge denied an request by the Standing Rock Sioux to put a freeze on construction. But an hour later, the Obama administration surprised everyone by stepping in and ordering the Army Corps of Engineers to hit pause until it could revisit the controversial portion near the reservation. Further protests are expected in the coming days and months, and politicians like Bernie Sanders are joining the fray. This is becoming a bigger and bigger story. So here’s a guide to how we got this point. What is the Dakota Access Pipeline? The pipeline in question was originally proposed in 2014 by Dakota Access, a subsidiary of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners. If built, it would carry at least 470,000 barrels of crude per day from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota down to a terminal in Illinois, where it could be shipped to refineries and turned into usable fuel. The whole thing would stretch 1,134 miles underground and cost some $3.7 billion: (Energy Transfer, LLC) The rationale for this project is simple enough. Since the late 2000s, drillers have been using advanced fracking techniques to exploit vast new deposits of oil in the shale formations of North Dakota. Crude oil output has surged, and the state has become one of the epicenters of the recent US oil boom. But because this all happened so quickly, there aren’t sufficient pipelines to carry all that new oil to market. North Dakota drillers have instead been shipping thousands of barrels of crude each day by rail, which is costlier and also sometimes leads to exploding trains. Oil companies would prefer a cheaper, quieter pipeline, especially now that crude prices have collapsed and profits are thinner. Hence the proposal. Why is the Dakota Access pipeline so controversial? Although oil pipelines tend to be less accident-prone than trains, they’ve certainly been known to leak — with destructive results. So there’s been scattered opposition along the proposed route, starting with farmers in Iowa, ever since late 2014. But by far the biggest source of controversy has been in North Dakota, around the portion of pipeline that would run north of Cannon Ball, Sioux County, home of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and a reservation of 8,000 people. See the red square below: (Energy Transfer Partners, LLC) For months, members of the Standing Rock Sioux have raised two major concerns about the project: First, the pipeline would cross right under the Missouri River at Lake Oahe, the reservation’s main source of drinking water. A leak or oil spill could prove disastrous. The tribe points out that the pipeline was originally supposed to go farther north, near Bismarck, but officials had blocked that path out of concern that a leak might harm the state capital. Second, the tribe argues that the pipeline would run through a stretch of land north of the reservation that contains recently discovered sacred sites and burial places. True, this land isn’t part of the current reservation. But the Standing Rock Sioux pointed out that the land had been taken away from them unjustly over the past 150 years. And any bulldozing and construction work could damage these sites. (In response, Dakota Access has argued that it will employ “new advanced pipeline technology” to limit leaks — and that it will take care to protect any cultural sites.) More to the point, the Standing Rock Sioux argue that under federal law, the US government should have properly consulted with the tribe about these issues — and didn’t. On July 27, the Standing Rock Sioux and the nonprofit Earthjustice sued the Army Corps of Engineers in federal court, arguing that the agency had wrongly approved the pipeline without proper consultation. As journalist Aura Bogado explains, at the core of this dispute is the concept of “tribal sovereignty.” The US government is supposed to have a “government-to-government” relationship with native tribes — not run roughshod over them. Since March, thousands of Native Americans from across the country have come to Cannon Ball to camp out and protest the pipeline in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux. The fight has also attracted the interest of climate activists and environmentalists, who have been focused on blocking new fossil fuel infrastructure, particularly after their victory in stopping the Keystone XL pipeline last year. It’s also attracted the interest of politicians like Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein. The Missouri River is seen beyond an encampment September 4, 2016, near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, where hundreds of people have gathered to join the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline. (Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images) In recent months, the fight seriously intensified, with protestors successfully interfering with construction. On August 24, the Standing Rock Sioux asked the DC Circuit Court for an injunction to halt activity on the pipeline while their broader lawsuit against the pipeline was resolved (which could take up to a year). On September 3, shortly after the injunction was requested, Dakota Access deployed bulldozers and started digging up the section of the pipeline route that contained possible native burial artifacts — widely viewed as an attempt to circumvent the lawsuit and make the pipeline inevitable. Protesters tried to stop the bulldozers, and there’s video of private security responding with dogs and pepper spray. Five days later, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple activated the state National Guard \"in the event they are needed to support law enforcement response efforts.\" What’s the lawsuit over the pipeline all about? Wiyake Eagleman of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe participates during a rally on Dakota Access Pipeline August 24, 2016, outside US District Court in Washington, DC. Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images The Army Corps of Engineers is the federal agency that has to approve any interstate pipelines. But, by law, any federal agency overseeing a construction project has to consult with native nations or tribes if there are places with “religious and cultural significance” nearby. (This is true even if those places are not explicitly part of a reservation — a recognition that many tribes have been relocated by the federal government and had their lands taken over the years.) In their complaint, filed on July 27, the Standing Rock Sioux argued that the Army Corps of Engineers hastily approved the project and only consulted them very late in the game — once the pipeline was basically a foregone conclusion. What’s more, the tribe argued that the company building the pipeline had used outdated maps to survey the lands beforehand, which meant it missed more recent and important archaeological discoveries that made the lands in the path of the pipeline so significant. You should read Robinson Meyer in the Atlantic for much more on the legal merits of the case here. He argues that the Standing Rock Sioux have a reasonable case — the law is pretty clear that native nations or tribes need to be consulted extensively, in a “government-to-government” fashion. This case is currently being heard by US District Judge James E. Boasberg, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Obama in 2011. It could take months to reach a resolution. In the meantime, the Standing Rock Sioux and the nonprofit Earthjustice had asked for an injunction to halt construction while the case was being decided. On September 9, Boasberg denied that request for an injunction. You can read his reasoning here. He sets the scene by noting, “Since the founding of this nation, the United States’ relationship with the Indian tribes has been contentious and tragic.” He then went on to argue that the tribe “has not shown it will suffer injury that would be prevented by any injunction the Court could issue” and that the Army Corps \"gave the Tribe a reasonable and good-faith opportunity to identify sites of importance to it.\" Almost immediately after that ruling, however, the Obama administration stepped in and ordered a stop to construction around Lake Oahe until the Army Corps of Engineers can revisit the disputes over this portion of the pipeline. “Furthermore,” the Department of Justice, Department of Interior, and Department of the Army said in a letter, “this case has highlighted the need for a serious discussion on whether there should be nationwide reform with respect to considering tribes’ views on these types of infrastructure projects.” For now, this portion of the pipeline is in limbo and the legal battles will continue. As Earthjustice explains, the broader lawsuit against the pipeline is still moving forward — and may not get resolved before the end of 2016, at least. What’s more, Dakota Access still must get one last bit of approval from the Army Corps of Engineers before digging on either side of Lake Oahe. In the meantime, the Standing Rock Sioux isn’t backing down, and organizers are planning further #NoDAPL protests around the country. Here’s Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux: \"We're going to continue to (fight this battle) as long as it takes to try and have his nation recognize the injustices that are being implemented on our nation.\" Further reading: Alexander Sammon of Mother Jones has an excellent timeline of the protests around the pipeline.

Share this Video: Facebook Twitter tv-pg Share this Page: Facebook Twitter Space Ghost Coast to Coast  = Requires a cable provider login Season 1 EP 1 Spanish Translation After declaring his fondness for Mexican food, Space Ghost asks diet guru Susan Powter what super powers help \"stop the insanity.\" Comedian Kevin Meaney discusses the virtues of wearing tight pants and the Bee Gees stop by for a short, bizarre visit. EP 2 Gilligan Three stranded castaways, Bob Denver (Gilligan), Dawn Wells (Mary Ann) and Russell Johnson (the Professor), take their turns in the video monitor. Zorak declares, \"I am the lone locust of the apocalypse. Think of me when you look to the night sky.\" EP 3 Elevator Self-proclaimed goddess of the galaxy Judy Tenuta and Space Ghost decide to visit the Elvis Chapel in Las Vegas. Space Ghost also talks with Dr. Timothy Leary, a man branded by Nixon as \"the most dangerous man alive.\" Then, it's tacos for everybody, even actress Ashley Judd. EP 4 CHiPs Space Ghost welcomes two talk-show experts, Bill Carter and Joe Franklin. Carter, author of \"The Late Shift,\"explains why Space Ghost was excluded from his book. Franklin, the world's first TV talk show host, gives him a few pointers. Moltar introduces his fascination with the television series \"CHiPs,\"a theme that will resurface again and again. EP 5 Bobcat During an otherwise friendly interview with comedian Bobcat Goldthwait, Zorak reveals Space Ghost's secret identity: Tad Ghostal. Goldthwait agrees to party with Space Ghost after the show. The festivities are spoiled, however, by Zorak and his punk friends, The Ramones. EP 6 Punch After model Cyndi Guyer, the female Fabio, explains what she looks for in a man, the Jerky Boys arrive and promptly threaten to punch Space Ghost in the mouth. The undertow of violence subsides with the appearance of model Dian Parkinson. EP 7 Banjo Space Ghost is nurturing a special pet—Banjo the sea monkey. Zorak sabotages the interview with Schooly D by hypnotically controlling Space Ghost's mind. Weird Al Yankovic reveals that he can eat his weight in Ding Dongs, but his interview is cut short by Banjo, now a colossal brine shrimp intent on destroying the set. EP 8 Batmantis A mysterious villain kidnaps Moltar and Space Ghost must solicit the help of Adam West, Lee Meriweather and Eartha Kitt, all from the \"Batman\"television series, in an effort to save him. And...holy exoskeleton, Space Ghost, it's Zorak as Batmantis! EP 9 Self Help Hoping to rehabilitate Zorak, Space Ghost welcomes psychiatrist Dr. Joyce Brothers, who ends up being more concerned about him. Later, comic Rich Hall give Space Ghost pointers on how to pick up women that are immediately used by Zorak and Moltar to impress author Anka Radakovich. EP 10 Gum, Disease The rapport between Branford Marsalis and Space Ghost makes it look as though the then-band leader of \"The Tonight Show\"might be switching talk shows. Next, a child star from the same television era as Space Ghost, Danny Bonaduce, talks about his days with the Partridge family and his deep-seated hatred for Osmonds. Season 2 EP 1 President's Day Nightmare Space Ghost shows off his versatility by emceeing Cartoon Network's \"World Premiere Toon In\". Members of the Council of Doom appear as judges in a beauty pageant-style competition between five cartoon directors. Blip also makes an appearance, prompting Space Ghost to croon, \"Oh, what a monkey he is!\" EP 2 Le Livre d'Histoire \"Le Livre d'Histoire\" is the electronic marriage of \"The Mask\" and \"Story Book\" with the addition of Lokar as host. \"The Mask\" was created as a trailer for the New Line Home Video Release of \"The Mask,\" starring Jim Carrey. It features Carrey's hilarious impersonation of a mantis. EP 3 Girlie Show Space Ghost pays tribute to \"Women in the Entertainment Industry.\"First, actress Fran Drescher paralyzes Space Ghost with desire. Carol Channing dispenses motherly advice to soothe his troubled heart, but this comfort is ruined by the appearance of rocker Alice Cooper, who Space Ghost has mistaken for a woman. EP 4 Hungry Space Ghost welcomes shiny happy Michael Stipe from R.E.M. (Space Ghost: \"Is that you in the corner?\"Stipe: \"Yes, it is.\") Later, he shares time-honored difficult-places-to-reach-while-scratching-stories with Lassie. Mujibur and Sirajul, frequent guest stars on \"The Late Show with David Letterman,\"mysteriously appear with Space Ghost's pizza. EP 5 Fire Drill David Byrne of the Talking Heads makes a striking revelation to Space Ghost: \"I would like to be cute and blonde. \"Later, Space Ghost attempts to get to the root of the feud between former teen idols Donny Osmond and earlier guest Danny Bonaduce. EP 6 Sleeper Feeling a little wired, Space Ghost asks professional wrestler Hulk Hogan to put him in a sleeper hold so that he can get some rest. Instead, Hogan recites an original haiku about Zorak. Slash from Guns 'N' Roses winds up the show with his usual gift for gab. EP 7 Jerk In his quest for one award-winning show, Space Ghost adds a few new twists: a live studio audience (full of Zorak's relatives), a remarkably versatile applause sign and viewer call-in. The results fall flat and Space Ghost isn't happy. In fact, guests Palmer Mills and Sandra Bernhard come to agree that Space Ghost is a real jerk. EP 8 Urges It's mating season on Zorak's home planet. Despite the rather unpleasant role the male plays in the mantis love ritual, Zorak gives in to that most common of insect impulses and returns home. Meanwhile, Space Ghost welcomes giggly actress Catherine Bach and plays the blues with musician Matthew Sweet. Season 3 EP 1 Explode Lokar, a villain from Space Ghost's original series, attempts to woo Moltar away from his helm as director. Oblivious, Space Ghost proceeds with his celebrity guests--Terry Jones and Glen Phillips--one of whom reveals his secret identity as Tongue Man. EP 2 $20.01 This loose parody of Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" features Joel Hodgson, creator of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000,\" and comedic magicians Penn and Teller. Moltar and Zorak are fired when Space Ghost replaces them with MOE 2000, an unfeeling computer director.

The despondent Ghost finds that not even the antics of comedian Carrot Top can lure him from his lovesick stupor.

EP 6 Boo! Space Ghost turns to experts for advice on supernatural phenomena such as the disappearance of his phantom cruiser keys. Guests Michael Norman, ghost expert and author of \"Historic Haunted America,\" and Bill Nye of \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\" are all too happy to help him out. EP 7 Freak Show Marshall \"Duh\" Staxx of the musical group Green Jelly and yodeller Wylie Gustafson are the freaks du jour in this aptly named episode. The show also features a video pirate who identifies himself only as \"Commander Andy of the Cosmos.\" EP 8 Switcheroo Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! EP 9 Surprise After Moltar sends Space Ghost away to \"pick up an important package in the mailroom,\" Zorak takes a seat behind the desk. What happens next is television history as Zorak cackles through a rapid-fire series of \"interviews\" with everyone from actress Cameron Diaz to TV's Jimmie \"Good Times\" Walker. EP 10 Glen Campbell Moltar puts the show on \"automated technical direction\" and disappears in accordance with a manual he's reading entitled \"The Joy of Escape.\" Space Ghost, meanwhile, welcomes Matt Groening, creator and executive producer of television's \"The Simpsons.\" EP 11 Jacksonville With Moltar on the run, suspense dominates this episode, from its Martin Quinn Production open to its \"Charlie's Angels\"-inspired cutaways and faux-spy drama epilogue. Space Ghost is forced to recruit Tansut as his fill-in director, who causes problems before bringing out guests Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield of Metallica. EP 12 Late Show Former \"Late Show With David Letterman\" writers scripted this unabashed spoof of late-night talk show convention. Janeane Garofalo reveals her secret power, then hypnotist Flip Orley joins Space Ghost until Zorak, using an incantation, turns him into David Grohl of the Foo Fighters. Sitting in with the band is John Popper of Blues Traveler. EP 13 Cookout After a show open that features Moltar and Zorak arguing the respective merits of Beefaroni and Beefaghetti, Space Ghost enlists the Council of Doom to judge an old-fashioned cooking competition between three nationally-acclaimed culinary experts: Emeril Lagasse, Nathalie Dupree and Martin Yan. EP 14 Art Show Performance artist Laurie Anderson riles Space Ghost by revealing that she never watches television, then waxes conspiratorial about cyberspace. A disengaged Space Ghost invisos out, missing much of their remaining conversation. Next, Space Ghost endeavors to understand members of the performance troupe Stomp. EP 15 Woody Allen's Fall Project In an apparent tribute to E! Entertainment's well-publicized re-enactments of the O.J. Simpson hearings, viewers are treated to performances of selected \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" moments by the Ghost Planet Dinner Theater Ensemble of Doraville, GA. Season 4 EP 1 Rehearsal This flashback episode transports viewers to a dress rehearsal two days before the premiere of \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" in April 1994. Offering a rare glimpse behind the scenes, \"Rehearsal\" features Space Ghost, Moltar and Zorak flubbing familiar gags, missing cues and mistiming special effects. EP 2 Gallagher Space Ghost introduces \"Space Time Quiz Fun 9000\" and his \"contestants,\" comedians David Cross and Bob Odenkirk of HBO's \"Mr. Show.\" What follows is a rapid-fire conversation in more ways than one, as Odenkirk's growing addiction to power-band blasts results in a steady volley from Space Ghost. EP 3 Edelweiss Zorak is zapped until he can apparently no longer regenerate, leaving Space Ghost without a bandleader. Moltar is instructed to fill in for his dearly departed friend by singing renditions of German folk songs, which puts Beck, the show's lone guest, to sleep. EP 4 Anniversary Space Ghost marks a \"special notch in the belt that is the Space Ghost saga\" with returning guests Bobcat Goldthwait and Judy Tenuda. The show also includes special appearances by villian-turned-announcer Tansut and the evil Chad Ghostal, as well as a spectacular career retrospective montage compiled by Moltar. EP 5 Zoltran Space Ghost chats with Robin Leach until his guest reveals that he is, in fact, an evil villain named Zoltran. Leach, as Zoltran, blasts Space Ghost by shooting lasers out of his eyes. Unfortunately for Space Ghost, the show doesn't get any easier as Merrill Markoe needles him about his age and his intergalactic location.

EP 7 Speck Reggae star Jimmy Cliff chats with Space Ghost about his new album and touring in South America. Moltar and mechanic-turned-musician Jack Logan share a creepy conversation about items underneath their beds. An irritating speck in Space Ghost's eye stops the show cold, a final calamity on a night of amusing mishaps. EP 8 Zorak Space Ghost presents a special tribute to Zorak. Dr. Maxcy Nolan, professor of entomology at the University of Georgia, speculates that the bandleader may be hiding an extra set of legs under his vest. Exterminator Steve Arnold, meanwhile, reveals that he says \"Take this!\" before going after insects. EP 9 Switcheroo '97 Space Ghost's two sidekicks have hosted a science-fiction convention behind his back.

EP 10 Mayonnaise While attempting to introduce Jon Stewart to the wonders of aroma therapy--\"picture a camel, if you will, traipsing across the desert sands\"--Moltar accidentally cuts off his oxygen. Stewart is revived to chat with Space Ghost about talk shows. Advice from Mike Douglas leads to an inspired musical ending. EP 11 Brilliant Number One Space Ghost pays homage to his real boss by continually referring to Peter Fonda as \"Ted Turner's brother-in-law.\" Fonda demands to have eyes drawn on Space Ghost, causing blindness for our superhero host. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin also appears and admits that he has only landed on the moon... and not Ghost Planet. EP 12 Boo Boo Kitty Self-heralded \"comedy ghetto\" resident Michael McKean barely gets a word in with Space Ghost, and David Lander suffers a similar fate. The reason? Zorak and Space Ghost's roommate tiff spilling over into the show. In addition, a menacing \"kitty\" blimp hovers around Ghost Planet. EP 13 Needledrop Even though two prominent rappers, Ice-T and Ernie-C, make their \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" debut, Space Ghost decides to do the \"hip shake\" throughout the show. Zorak attempts to hypnotize all the guests, including actor Fred Willard. EP 14 Sphinx \"Beavis and Butthead\" and \"King of the Hill\" creator Mike Judge kindly asks Space Ghost to \"whack the Rugrats.\" Space Ghost agrees to the job, as long as he can get onto one of Judge's shows. Harland Williams doesn't last long after calling Space Ghost \"Billy\" and \"Naughty Space Ghost.\" EP 15 Pavement Indie rock group Pavement, sitting in for an incarcerated Zorak and The Original Way-Outs, makes history as the first band ever to perform on \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast.\" Goldie Hawn, Tommy Davidson, Red Green and Colin Quinn also appear in an episode scripted by Space Ghost himself.

EP 17 Hipster Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin!

Grandpa Ghostal interviews kid actress Raven Symone. EP 19 Suckup Desperate for a new gig, Space Ghost kisses up to \"Talk Soup\" host John Henson and \"Entertainment Tonight\" host Bob Goen by telling each that they are \"pretty men.\" Space Ghost even offers to set Henson up with his \"sister\" Judy. Brak spoils the affair by spilling gravy all over the set. EP 20 Dam \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" welcomes its first-ever Academy Award-winner, Charlton Heston, who, after much prodding, offers his trophy to Space Ghost. Rumor has it that Heston tells an interesting \"Planet of the Apes\" story, but Zorak and Moltar decide to screech over the actor's voice. EP 21 Boat Show The deep space set comes alive like never before with 11 glorious musical numbers. Space Ghost, Zorak and Moltar are joined by Brak, who performs a melodic \"Man on the Street\" duet with the originator of the popular skit, Steve Allen. Andy Dick and Space Ghost display a remarkable chemistry in their inspiring rendition of \"Clickety Click.\" EP 22 Telethon When the \"Council of Doom\" takes your phone calls and the only caller is Brak posing as \"Seymour Hiney,\" you know your telethon is in trouble. Of course, it takes Space Ghost until the telethon's disappointing ending to realize his show is completely bankrupt... for good!

The tunnel is marked with its closing date: June 29, 2016. Credit Caitlin O'Hara for The New York Times NOGALES, Ariz. — On an embankment that runs along a towering steel fence separating this border town from its Mexican sister city, a patch of new concrete with a date carved into it stands out, marking the exit of a tunnel Border Patrol agents sealed in May. Dozens more like it snake around town, part of a vast underground network that Mexican drug cartels have used for years to funnel hundreds of pounds of illicit drugs into the United States. When Border Patrol agents find the tunnels, they dump concrete to seal them and stamp them with the date that they are shut down. But they struggle to stay ahead of the digging. Last Friday, the Border Patrol, in a joint operation with Mexican authorities, discovered an unfinished tunnel that started in a Mexican cemetery. “The clock is ticking as soon as they complete a tunnel,” said Kevin Hecht, a Border Patrol tunneling expert. “They know that we will eventually find them. But if even one load gets through before we find it, they consider it a success.” While Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has made building a wall at the border a central element of his campaign, the fence here that reaches up to 30 feet has done little to deter enterprising drug smugglers. It has simply helped push them underground. Border Patrol agents cannot hear smugglers digging and do not know how many tunnels there are, a gap in border security that homeland security experts say renders talk of a wall moot. “The Border Patrol has done an incredible job, given its resources,” said Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director in the Clinton administration. “But it would be a stretch to say that the border and border communities are secure when the agency lacks a high-confidence ability to detect cross-border tunnels. No wall is going to fix that.” Video Tunneling Under the Border With Mexico On the U.S.-Mexico border, a large fence has done little to deter enterprising drug smugglers. In Nogales, Ariz., they’ve been digging out tunnels for years in order to cross the border undetected. By NEIL COLLIER and RON NIXON on Publish Date September 1, 2016. Photo by U.S. Border Patrol. Watch in Times Video » embed During his immigration speech Wednesday in Arizona, Mr. Trump said his border security plan would use the best technology, including above- and below-ground sensors to “find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels.” Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story But no technology exists to reliably detect the tunnels, and experts say it may be years before such a system is developed. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Since the first drug tunnel was discovered in 1990 in Douglas, Ariz., border officials say they have found nearly 200 more along the nearly 2,000-mile Southwest border, mostly in Arizona and California. Tunnels are so numerous in the Nogales area that Border Patrol agents described the ground underneath the city as “Swiss cheese.” Mr. Hecht said smugglers dig tunnels mostly into the drainage system shared by the two cities. Others are burrowed into the basements of homes on the American side from buildings in Mexico. One tunnel was dug under a heavily guarded port of entry.

These tools have helped federal investigators track and arrest hundreds of smuggling suspects, and seize tons of marijuana, methamphetamines and cocaine. Remote-controlled robots help agents explore tunnels that are too risky for humans to enter. The American government has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into research in hopes of finding a way to detect tunnels, but most of these efforts have ended in disappointment. Most recently, the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security concluded that none of the current methods used to detect underground tunnels were “necessarily suited to Border Patrol agents’ operational needs.” In the absence of technology to detect tunnels, Border Patrol officials have worked with Mexican authorities to develop informants and patrol the border, including water and sewerage infrastructure, looking for suspicious activity. About half of the Border Patrol agents here have been trained to work underground. “But you don’t know what you don’t know,” said R. Gil Kerlikowske, the United States Customs and Border Protection commissioner, who conceded that many more tunnels might exist.

Credit Eros Hoagland for The New York Times Part of the problem in detecting tunnels, say experts like Paul Bauman, a Canadian geophysicist, is the ground itself. Finding what is under the surface is not as simple as shooting radar or electromagnetic waves into the ground, he said.

Privacy Policy With underground cracks, water tables, tree roots and caves, it is hard to tell what is and is not a tunnel, he said. Mr. Bauman, who has worked with the Israel Defense Forces in their efforts to find tunnels, said most of the devices used for tunnel detection were developed for industries to find oil or mineral deposits, not drug tunnels. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Carey M. Rappaport, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Northeastern University in Boston, said the depth of many tunnels also posed a technological challenge. Some can be as deep as 90 feet, beyond the reach of most ground-radar devices and sensors. Photo Wendi Lee, a Border Patrol agent, driving past an area of San Diego where several drug tunnels have been discovered. Credit Eros Hoagland for The New York Times “Soil is very good at keeping secrets,” said Mr. Rappaport, who has also worked with the United States and Israeli governments on tunnel-detection methods. In the 2016 defense authorization bill, Congress provided about $120 million for a joint Defense Department and Israel Defense Forces tunnel-detection project. Israel is among several nations, including Egypt, Jordan and South Korea, that have had major problems with hostile groups using tunnels to stage attacks. American officials hope the technology developed in Israel can aid efforts on the Mexican border. A spokeswoman for the Israeli Defense Ministry declined to comment. The Science and Technology Directorate at Homeland Security is also spending several million dollars a year to fund tunnel-detection research. In San Diego, a task force of agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, the Border Patrol and the Drug Enforcement Administration has tried a variety of technologies to detect tunnels, much like their colleagues in Nogales have. OPEN Document Document: A Report to Congress on Drug-Smuggling Tunnels One of the tools is a ground-radar machine that looks like a large lawn mower. The device, which is intended to locate underground utility lines and flaws in road construction, shoots radar waves about 10 feet into the ground. A screen displays various shades that identify anomalies underground that could be tunnels. But that is often not deep enough. “We’ve never found a tunnel using them,” said David Shaw, a special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in San Diego. Mr. Shaw said the task force relied mainly on old-fashioned law enforcement techniques, such as cultivating informants in cartels or getting business owners and residents to report suspicious activities. Advertisement Continue reading the main story That’s how the most recent tunnel in San Diego was discovered in April. Its exit was in a fenced-off area in the heavily industrial Otay Mesa warehouse district, about 500 yards from the border. According to Wendi Lee, a Border Patrol agent, business owners across the street alerted the agency to what they said was suspicious activity. The tunnel, hidden under a trash bin, was about 800 yards long. The authorities seized about 2,200 pounds of cocaine and 14,000 pounds of marijuana. The tunnel was one of about a half-dozen discovered in the area in recent years. “Smugglers keep digging them because the tunnels work,” Mr. Shaw said. Still, some law enforcement officials say their efforts appear to be having an effect. Data from Homeland Security shows that fewer tunnels have been discovered in recent years. However, Mr. Hecht of the Border Patrol in Nogales said the number of tunnels discovered should not be used to measure success. “For every tunnel we find, we feel they’re building another one somewhere, and they might get more creative in concealing it,” he said. “Next year, I could find 10. Until there is some device on the market to help us accurately detect them, we just won’t know.” Follow Ron Nixon on Twitter @nixonron.

Later, it is revealed that Space Ghost is married to Bjork. Space Ghost ends the episode by knocking her off of a cliff. Share this Video: Facebook Twitter tv-pg Share this Page: Facebook Twitter Space Ghost Coast to Coast  = Requires a cable provider login Season 1 EP 1 Spanish Translation After declaring his fondness for Mexican food, Space Ghost asks diet guru Susan Powter what super powers help \"stop the insanity.\" Comedian Kevin Meaney discusses the virtues of wearing tight pants and the Bee Gees stop by for a short, bizarre visit. EP 2 Gilligan Three stranded castaways, Bob Denver (Gilligan), Dawn Wells (Mary Ann) and Russell Johnson (the Professor), take their turns in the video monitor. Zorak declares, \"I am the lone locust of the apocalypse. Think of me when you look to the night sky.\" EP 3 Elevator Self-proclaimed goddess of the galaxy Judy Tenuta and Space Ghost decide to visit the Elvis Chapel in Las Vegas. Space Ghost also talks with Dr. Timothy Leary, a man branded by Nixon as \"the most dangerous man alive.\" Then, it's tacos for everybody, even actress Ashley Judd. EP 4 CHiPs Space Ghost welcomes two talk-show experts, Bill Carter and Joe Franklin. Carter, author of \"The Late Shift,\"explains why Space Ghost was excluded from his book. Franklin, the world's first TV talk show host, gives him a few pointers. Moltar introduces his fascination with the television series \"CHiPs,\"a theme that will resurface again and again. EP 5 Bobcat During an otherwise friendly interview with comedian Bobcat Goldthwait, Zorak reveals Space Ghost's secret identity: Tad Ghostal. Goldthwait agrees to party with Space Ghost after the show. The festivities are spoiled, however, by Zorak and his punk friends, The Ramones. EP 6 Punch After model Cyndi Guyer, the female Fabio, explains what she looks for in a man, the Jerky Boys arrive and promptly threaten to punch Space Ghost in the mouth. The undertow of violence subsides with the appearance of model Dian Parkinson. EP 7 Banjo Space Ghost is nurturing a special pet—Banjo the sea monkey. Zorak sabotages the interview with Schooly D by hypnotically controlling Space Ghost's mind. Weird Al Yankovic reveals that he can eat his weight in Ding Dongs, but his interview is cut short by Banjo, now a colossal brine shrimp intent on destroying the set. EP 8 Batmantis A mysterious villain kidnaps Moltar and Space Ghost must solicit the help of Adam West, Lee Meriweather and Eartha Kitt, all from the \"Batman\"television series, in an effort to save him. And...holy exoskeleton, Space Ghost, it's Zorak as Batmantis! EP 9 Self Help Hoping to rehabilitate Zorak, Space Ghost welcomes psychiatrist Dr. Joyce Brothers, who ends up being more concerned about him. Later, comic Rich Hall give Space Ghost pointers on how to pick up women that are immediately used by Zorak and Moltar to impress author Anka Radakovich. EP 10 Gum, Disease The rapport between Branford Marsalis and Space Ghost makes it look as though the then-band leader of \"The Tonight Show\"might be switching talk shows. Next, a child star from the same television era as Space Ghost, Danny Bonaduce, talks about his days with the Partridge family and his deep-seated hatred for Osmonds. Season 2 EP 1 President's Day Nightmare Space Ghost shows off his versatility by emceeing Cartoon Network's \"World Premiere Toon In\". Members of the Council of Doom appear as judges in a beauty pageant-style competition between five cartoon directors. Blip also makes an appearance, prompting Space Ghost to croon, \"Oh, what a monkey he is!\" EP 2 Le Livre d'Histoire \"Le Livre d'Histoire\" is the electronic marriage of \"The Mask\" and \"Story Book\" with the addition of Lokar as host. \"The Mask\" was created as a trailer for the New Line Home Video Release of \"The Mask,\" starring Jim Carrey. It features Carrey's hilarious impersonation of a mantis. EP 3 Girlie Show Space Ghost pays tribute to \"Women in the Entertainment Industry.\"First, actress Fran Drescher paralyzes Space Ghost with desire. Carol Channing dispenses motherly advice to soothe his troubled heart, but this comfort is ruined by the appearance of rocker Alice Cooper, who Space Ghost has mistaken for a woman. EP 4 Hungry Space Ghost welcomes shiny happy Michael Stipe from R.E.M. (Space Ghost: \"Is that you in the corner?\"Stipe: \"Yes, it is.\") Later, he shares time-honored difficult-places-to-reach-while-scratching-stories with Lassie. Mujibur and Sirajul, frequent guest stars on \"The Late Show with David Letterman,\"mysteriously appear with Space Ghost's pizza. EP 5 Fire Drill David Byrne of the Talking Heads makes a striking revelation to Space Ghost: \"I would like to be cute and blonde. \"Later, Space Ghost attempts to get to the root of the feud between former teen idols Donny Osmond and earlier guest Danny Bonaduce. EP 6 Sleeper Feeling a little wired, Space Ghost asks professional wrestler Hulk Hogan to put him in a sleeper hold so that he can get some rest. Instead, Hogan recites an original haiku about Zorak. Slash from Guns 'N' Roses winds up the show with his usual gift for gab. EP 7 Jerk In his quest for one award-winning show, Space Ghost adds a few new twists: a live studio audience (full of Zorak's relatives), a remarkably versatile applause sign and viewer call-in. The results fall flat and Space Ghost isn't happy. In fact, guests Palmer Mills and Sandra Bernhard come to agree that Space Ghost is a real jerk. EP 8 Urges It's mating season on Zorak's home planet. Despite the rather unpleasant role the male plays in the mantis love ritual, Zorak gives in to that most common of insect impulses and returns home. Meanwhile, Space Ghost welcomes giggly actress Catherine Bach and plays the blues with musician Matthew Sweet. Season 3 EP 1 Explode Lokar, a villain from Space Ghost's original series, attempts to woo Moltar away from his helm as director. Oblivious, Space Ghost proceeds with his celebrity guests--Terry Jones and Glen Phillips--one of whom reveals his secret identity as Tongue Man. EP 2 $20.01 This loose parody of Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" features Joel Hodgson, creator of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000,\" and comedic magicians Penn and Teller. Moltar and Zorak are fired when Space Ghost replaces them with MOE 2000, an unfeeling computer director. EP 3 Lovesick Debuting on Valentine's Day, this episode finds Space Ghost heartbroken over a failed relationship. The despondent Ghost finds that not even the antics of comedian Carrot Top can lure him from his lovesick stupor. EP 4 Transcript Musician Jonathan Richman, who first climbed to fame fronting The Modern Lovers, favors Space Ghost with a couple of charming songs during a meandering conversation. EP 5 Sharrock Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore stars as Fred Cracklin in a 15-minute showcase for late musician Sonny Sharrock. Sharrock was the man behind the \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" theme music. EP 6 Boo! Space Ghost turns to experts for advice on supernatural phenomena such as the disappearance of his phantom cruiser keys. Guests Michael Norman, ghost expert and author of \"Historic Haunted America,\" and Bill Nye of \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\" are all too happy to help him out. EP 7 Freak Show Marshall \"Duh\" Staxx of the musical group Green Jelly and yodeller Wylie Gustafson are the freaks du jour in this aptly named episode. The show also features a video pirate who identifies himself only as \"Commander Andy of the Cosmos.\" EP 8 Switcheroo Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! Evil Twin! EP 9 Surprise After Moltar sends Space Ghost away to \"pick up an important package in the mailroom,\" Zorak takes a seat behind the desk. What happens next is television history as Zorak cackles through a rapid-fire series of \"interviews\" with everyone from actress Cameron Diaz to TV's Jimmie \"Good Times\" Walker. EP 10 Glen Campbell Moltar puts the show on \"automated technical direction\" and disappears in accordance with a manual he's reading entitled \"The Joy of Escape.\" Space Ghost, meanwhile, welcomes Matt Groening, creator and executive producer of television's \"The Simpsons.\" EP 11 Jacksonville With Moltar on the run, suspense dominates this episode, from its Martin Quinn Production open to its \"Charlie's Angels\"-inspired cutaways and faux-spy drama epilogue. Space Ghost is forced to recruit Tansut as his fill-in director, who causes problems before bringing out guests Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield of Metallica. EP 12 Late Show Former \"Late Show With David Letterman\" writers scripted this unabashed spoof of late-night talk show convention. Janeane Garofalo reveals her secret power, then hypnotist Flip Orley joins Space Ghost until Zorak, using an incantation, turns him into David Grohl of the Foo Fighters. Sitting in with the band is John Popper of Blues Traveler. EP 13 Cookout After a show open that features Moltar and Zorak arguing the respective merits of Beefaroni and Beefaghetti, Space Ghost enlists the Council of Doom to judge an old-fashioned cooking competition between three nationally-acclaimed culinary experts: Emeril Lagasse, Nathalie Dupree and Martin Yan. EP 14 Art Show Performance artist Laurie Anderson riles Space Ghost by revealing that she never watches television, then waxes conspiratorial about cyberspace. A disengaged Space Ghost invisos out, missing much of their remaining conversation. Next, Space Ghost endeavors to understand members of the performance troupe Stomp. EP 15 Woody Allen's Fall Project In an apparent tribute to E! Entertainment's well-publicized re-enactments of the O.J. Simpson hearings, viewers are treated to performances of selected \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" moments by the Ghost Planet Dinner Theater Ensemble of Doraville, GA. Season 4 EP 1 Rehearsal This flashback episode transports viewers to a dress rehearsal two days before the premiere of \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" in April 1994. Offering a rare glimpse behind the scenes, \"Rehearsal\" features Space Ghost, Moltar and Zorak flubbing familiar gags, missing cues and mistiming special effects. EP 2 Gallagher Space Ghost introduces \"Space Time Quiz Fun 9000\" and his \"contestants,\" comedians David Cross and Bob Odenkirk of HBO's \"Mr. Show.\" What follows is a rapid-fire conversation in more ways than one, as Odenkirk's growing addiction to power-band blasts results in a steady volley from Space Ghost. EP 3 Edelweiss Zorak is zapped until he can apparently no longer regenerate, leaving Space Ghost without a bandleader. Moltar is instructed to fill in for his dearly departed friend by singing renditions of German folk songs, which puts Beck, the show's lone guest, to sleep. EP 4 Anniversary Space Ghost marks a \"special notch in the belt that is the Space Ghost saga\" with returning guests Bobcat Goldthwait and Judy Tenuda. The show also includes special appearances by villian-turned-announcer Tansut and the evil Chad Ghostal, as well as a spectacular career retrospective montage compiled by Moltar. EP 5 Zoltran Space Ghost chats with Robin Leach until his guest reveals that he is, in fact, an evil villain named Zoltran. Leach, as Zoltran, blasts Space Ghost by shooting lasers out of his eyes. Unfortunately for Space Ghost, the show doesn't get any easier as Merrill Markoe needles him about his age and his intergalactic location. EP 6 Pilot After revealing that contractual squabbles before the premiere of \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" resulted in an aborted test shoot starring rival superhero Birdman, host Lokar presents exclusive glimpses of this \"lost\" pilot. EP 7 Speck Reggae star Jimmy Cliff chats with Space Ghost about his new album and touring in South America. Moltar and mechanic-turned-musician Jack Logan share a creepy conversation about items underneath their beds. An irritating speck in Space Ghost's eye stops the show cold, a final calamity on a night of amusing mishaps. EP 8 Zorak Space Ghost presents a special tribute to Zorak. Dr. Maxcy Nolan, professor of entomology at the University of Georgia, speculates that the bandleader may be hiding an extra set of legs under his vest. Exterminator Steve Arnold, meanwhile, reveals that he says \"Take this!\" before going after insects. EP 9 Switcheroo '97 Space Ghost's two sidekicks have hosted a science-fiction convention behind his back. Moltar and Zorak bring out their own guests--Bill Mumy (Will Robinson of \"Lost in Space\") and Mark Hamill. In a jealous rage, Space Ghost announces plans for \"Space Ghost Con '97,\" vowing to exclude his co-stars. EP 10 Mayonnaise While attempting to introduce Jon Stewart to the wonders of aroma therapy--\"picture a camel, if you will, traipsing across the desert sands\"--Moltar accidentally cuts off his oxygen. Stewart is revived to chat with Space Ghost about talk shows. Advice from Mike Douglas leads to an inspired musical ending. EP 11 Brilliant Number One Space Ghost pays homage to his real boss by continually referring to Peter Fonda as \"Ted Turner's brother-in-law.\" Fonda demands to have eyes drawn on Space Ghost, causing blindness for our superhero host. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin also appears and admits that he has only landed on the moon... and not Ghost Planet. EP 12 Boo Boo Kitty Self-heralded \"comedy ghetto\" resident Michael McKean barely gets a word in with Space Ghost, and David Lander suffers a similar fate. The reason? Zorak and Space Ghost's roommate tiff spilling over into the show. In addition, a menacing \"kitty\" blimp hovers around Ghost Planet. EP 13 Needledrop Even though two prominent rappers, Ice-T and Ernie-C, make their \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" debut, Space Ghost decides to do the \"hip shake\" throughout the show. Zorak attempts to hypnotize all the guests, including actor Fred Willard.

The tunnel is marked with its closing date: June 29, 2016. Caitlin O'Hara for The New York Times By RON NIXON September 1, 2016 NOGALES, Ariz. — On an embankment that runs along a towering steel fence separating this border town from its Mexican sister city, a patch of new concrete with a date carved into it stands out, marking the exit of a tunnel Border Patrol agents sealed in May. Dozens more like it snake around town, part of a vast underground network that Mexican drug cartels have used for years to funnel hundreds of pounds of illicit drugs into the United States. When Border Patrol agents find the tunnels, they dump concrete to seal them and stamp them with the date that they are shut down. But they struggle to stay ahead of the digging. Last Friday, the Border Patrol, in a joint operation with Mexican authorities, discovered an unfinished tunnel that started in a Mexican cemetery. “The clock is ticking as soon as they complete a tunnel,” said Kevin Hecht, a Border Patrol tunneling expert. “They know that we will eventually find them. But if even one load gets through before we find it, they consider it a success.” While Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has made building a wall at the border a central element of his campaign, the fence here that reaches up to 30 feet has done little to deter enterprising drug smugglers. It has simply helped push them underground. Border Patrol agents cannot hear smugglers digging and do not know how many tunnels there are, a gap in border security that homeland security experts say renders talk of a wall moot. “The Border Patrol has done an incredible job, given its resources,” said Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director in the Clinton administration. “But it would be a stretch to say that the border and border communities are secure when the agency lacks a high-confidence ability to detect cross-border tunnels. No wall is going to fix that.” Watch LaterEmailFacebookTwitterWhatsApp Video On the U.S.-Mexico border, a large fence has done little to deter enterprising drug smugglers. In Nogales, Ariz., they’ve been digging out tunnels for years in order to cross the border undetected. During his immigration speech Wednesday in Arizona, Mr. Trump said his border security plan would use the best technology, including above- and below-ground sensors to “find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels.” But no technology exists to reliably detect the tunnels, and experts say it may be years before such a system is developed. Since the first drug tunnel was discovered in 1990 in Douglas, Ariz., border officials say they have found nearly 200 more along the nearly 2,000-mile Southwest border, mostly in Arizona and California. Tunnels are so numerous in the Nogales area that Border Patrol agents described the ground underneath the city as “Swiss cheese.” Mr. Hecht said smugglers dig tunnels mostly into the drainage system shared by the two cities. Others are burrowed into the basements of homes on the American side from buildings in Mexico. One tunnel was dug under a heavily guarded port of entry. Tunnels are so numerous in the Nogales area that Border Patrol agents have described the ground under the city as “Swiss cheese.” Caitlin O'Hara for The New York Times Technological advances such as ground radar to detect movement, hundreds of high-tech cameras with night-vision lenses and drones flying overhead have drastically transformed border security. These tools have helped federal investigators track and arrest hundreds of smuggling suspects, and seize tons of marijuana, methamphetamines and cocaine. Remote-controlled robots help agents explore tunnels that are too risky for humans to enter. The American government has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into research in hopes of finding a way to detect tunnels, but most of these efforts have ended in disappointment. Most recently, the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security concluded that none of the current methods used to detect underground tunnels were “necessarily suited to Border Patrol agents’ operational needs.” In the absence of technology to detect tunnels, Border Patrol officials have worked with Mexican authorities to develop informants and patrol the border, including water and sewerage infrastructure, looking for suspicious activity. About half of the Border Patrol agents here have been trained to work underground. “But you don’t know what you don’t know,” said R. Gil Kerlikowske, the United States Customs and Border Protection commissioner, who conceded that many more tunnels might exist. A machine that sends radar waves about 10 feet into the ground to help detect tunnels. Eros Hoagland for The New York Times Part of the problem in detecting tunnels, say experts like Paul Bauman, a Canadian geophysicist, is the ground itself. Finding what is under the surface is not as simple as shooting radar or electromagnetic waves into the ground, he said. With underground cracks, water tables, tree roots and caves, it is hard to tell what is and is not a tunnel, he said. Mr. Bauman, who has worked with the Israel Defense Forces in their efforts to find tunnels, said most of the devices used for tunnel detection were developed for industries to find oil or mineral deposits, not drug tunnels. Carey M. Rappaport, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Northeastern University in Boston, said the depth of many tunnels also posed a technological challenge. Some can be as deep as 90 feet, beyond the reach of most ground-radar devices and sensors. Wendi Lee, a Border Patrol agent, driving past an area of San Diego where several drug tunnels have been discovered. Eros Hoagland for The New York Times “Soil is very good at keeping secrets,” said Mr. Rappaport, who has also worked with the United States and Israeli governments on tunnel-detection methods. In the 2016 defense authorization bill, Congress provided about $120 million for a joint Defense Department and Israel Defense Forces tunnel-detection project. Israel is among several nations, including Egypt, Jordan and South Korea, that have had major problems with hostile groups using tunnels to stage attacks. American officials hope the technology developed in Israel can aid efforts on the Mexican border. A spokeswoman for the Israeli Defense Ministry declined to comment. The Science and Technology Directorate at Homeland Security is also spending several million dollars a year to fund tunnel-detection research. In San Diego, a task force of agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, the Border Patrol and the Drug Enforcement Administration has tried a variety of technologies to detect tunnels, much like their colleagues in Nogales have. Document | A Report to Congress on Drug-Smuggling Tunnels The Department of Homeland Security issued an annual report earlier this year on efforts to find and close cross-border tunnels. One of the tools is a ground-radar machine that looks like a large lawn mower. The device, which is intended to locate underground utility lines and flaws in road construction, shoots radar waves about 10 feet into the ground. A screen displays various shades that identify anomalies underground that could be tunnels. But that is often not deep enough. “We’ve never found a tunnel using them,” said David Shaw, a special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in San Diego. Mr. Shaw said the task force relied mainly on old-fashioned law enforcement techniques, such as cultivating informants in cartels or getting business owners and residents to report suspicious activities. That’s how the most recent tunnel in San Diego was discovered in April. Its exit was in a fenced-off area in the heavily industrial Otay Mesa warehouse district, about 500 yards from the border. According to Wendi Lee, a Border Patrol agent, business owners across the street alerted the agency to what they said was suspicious activity. The tunnel, hidden under a trash bin, was about 800 yards long. The authorities seized about 2,200 pounds of cocaine and 14,000 pounds of marijuana. The tunnel was one of about a half-dozen discovered in the area in recent years. “Smugglers keep digging them because the tunnels work,” Mr. Shaw said. Still, some law enforcement officials say their efforts appear to be having an effect. Data from Homeland Security shows that fewer tunnels have been discovered in recent years. However, Mr. Hecht of the Border Patrol in Nogales said the number of tunnels discovered should not be used to measure success. “For every tunnel we find, we feel they’re building another one somewhere, and they might get more creative in concealing it,” he said. “Next year, I could find 10. Until there is some device on the market to help us accurately detect them, we just won’t know.” Follow Ron Nixon on Twitter @nixonron.

Then he became the story—an avatar for all of our fluid modern ideals. He could be the dynamic human of the future, exploding age-old binaries with an eloquent note, melting racial divisions with a devastating turn of phrase or quick flit to falsetto. He breathed hope. Then he went away. Years clicked by. It was easy to worry. There are precedents for this sort of thing, for disappearances, for the self-implosion of black genius. Lauryn Hill. Dave Chappelle. “Black stardom is rough,” Chris Rock once said. “You represent the race, and you have responsibilities that go beyond your art. How dare you just be excellent?” The Rock quote is from a 2012 profile of the reclusive D’Angelo, who felt compelled to release his first album in 14 years following the shooting of Michael Brown; the moment spurred him on. Faced with a hellish loop of police brutality, other musical leaders like Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé came forth with brilliant righteousness as well. But not Frank. Though he posted several elegant messages online, reacting to horrors in Ferguson and Orlando, his relative silence only grew louder as tensions outside continued to rise. The stoic empathy he beamed throughout Channel Orange was missed. There was a yearning for his perspective—how he could soothe without losing sight of what’s important. How he allowed us to escape within his carefully drawn characters while never letting us off the hook. How his voice was allergic to nonsense, how it could shatter a heart into dust. It still can. “RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me,” he sings on “Nikes,” the opening track from Blonde, his wary exhale of a new album. In the song’s video, Frank holds up a framed photo of the 17-year-old martyr, the boy’s sad eyes tucked inside a hoodie. Even now, four years after the Florida teen was shot and killed with Skittles in his pocket, the line jolts. It’s also the most overtly political statement Frank makes across the entire record. And “Nikes” is hardly a call to arms. The song is a woozy, faded, screwed-down odyssey, replete with helium warble and dewy third eye—and it’s actually one of the album’s most propulsive tracks. On its surface, Blonde seems tremendously insular. Whereas Channel Orange showed off an expansive eclecticism, this album contracts at nearly every turn. Its spareness suggests a person in a small apartment with only a keyboard and a guitar and thoughts for company. But it isn’t just anyone emoting from the abyss, it’s Frank Ocean. In his hands, such intimacy attracts the ear, bubbles the brain, raises the flesh. These songs are not for marching, but they still serve a purpose. They’re about everyday lives, about the feat of just existing, which is a statement in its own right. Trayvon Martin would be 21 today, and Blonde is filled with feelings and ideas—deep love, heady philosophy, despondent loss—that he may have never had a chance to experience for himself. The stories Frank tells here find solace in sorrow. They’re fucked up and lonely, but not indulgent. They offer views into unseen places and overlooked souls. They console. They bleed. And yes, they cry. The power of Frank’s work often comes via extreme transparency, but he’s not writing diaries. It’s about how he’s able to locate the crux of any situation, or expose undue artifice, or peel things back to their naked core. Like how he skewed L.A. privilege without breaking a sweat on “Super Rich Kids” or broke down the Coachella generation’s bored numbness in five minutes on “Novacane.” Recently, he’s expanded this skill beyond music. It’s in the “Nikes” video, which both takes advantage of movie magic, like lighting a man (Frank?!) on fire, only to deflate the trickery by also showing the crew of extinguishers putting him out. It’s in the oversized, seven pound, coffee table magazine Boys Don’t Cry, which came out along with the new album; in it, screenshots of internet histories—perhaps the most accurate mirror of our modern selves—are on full display, along with literally naked bodies on and around his beloved sports cars, and charmingly unfiltered interviews with fellow artists and friends. (These chats can get a bit stoner-y, though amusingly so; in one, Frank asks Lil B, “is money sexy?”) And this transparency was also expressed in the current campaign’s prolonged rollout, which at one point had fans watching Frank watch paint dry as part of a live stream lead-up to a visual album called Endless. As a piece of filmed entertainment, Endless is painfully dull, and perhaps that’s the point. As we watch Frank build a spiral staircase with his bare hands, the piece offers a sort of anti-promo message that comments on how an album’s release strategy can often diminish the art it’s built to uphold nowadays. Or maybe, you know, it’s just really dull. Either way, the Endless soundtrack is much more exciting—46 minutes of music that plays like a mixtape, sliding from song to song, demo to demo, like scrolling through Frank’s hard drive of unreleased material. It’s an intriguing peek into his process, and it contains some of the rawest vocal takes he’s ever put out—like on the strung-out power ballad “Rushes”—but it lacks the clarity of Blonde. (In a neat inversion, it now looks like Frank used the relatively minor Endless to fulfill his major label contract and then self-released Blonde, the main event—though both were exclusives to Apple Music, putting into question what “self-released” even means at this point.) With Blonde’s unobtrusive instrumentation—large swaths go by without any drums whatsoever—the album could be mistaken for background music. But then Frank’s voice enters, and the overall quietness turns into a soft spotlight, capturing attention. It’s a technique pioneered by noted minimalists like Brian Eno and Rick Rubin, both of whom are included in Blonde’s who’s who list of contributors and inspirations. Many tracks feel emptied, with only the plain strumming of an electric guitar or foggy atmospherics left behind. But they mesmerize. Even a song like “Nights,” which sounds straightforward at first with its shards of silvery chords and midtempo beat, eventually turns into a strange shredding solo before ending with what sounds like a Drake dream heard underwater. “Nights” is not an anomaly. It’s the album’s centerpiece, by an artist who is following nobody but himself. Frank is 28 now, and his voice has grown stronger and more dexterous, while some of his tales have become more abstract. “Skyline To” is essentially a tone poem about sex, summer, and California haze backed by mood and mystery. “Godspeed” nods to gospel but stays grounded in its prayer to steadfast but broken love; a short story in the magazine, also called “Godspeed,” reads like uncanny science fiction but is actually based on Frank’s boyhood. Certain things are clear, though. The big questions are on his mind. He’s aware of his mortality now. He’s thinking about families, about what it means to live outside society, whether that’s a sustainable goal. He contemplates settling down with “two kids and a swimming pool” on “Seigfried,” a song that works in words by Elliott Smith and ends with a spaced-out soliloquy about living life in the red before a random solar flare brings chaos unto earth. This is not light fare. But the touch is oh so feathery. On “Solo,” he contemplates various stages of singledom, from the jacket-throwing hedonism to the smoked-out emptiness, with nothing but a churchly organ backing him up. It’s a stunning piece of songwriting that ultimately finds some peace with being alone. It sounds like a friend. Later on, “Solo (Reprise)” marks the album’s only major vocal guest appearance, with a devastating, head-spinning verse from André 3000. It pinpoints one of Blonde’s major themes: nostalgia. André looks back on his 20 years in hip-hop and feels duped by rappers who don’t write their own rhymes. “I’m hummin’ and whistlin’ to those not deserving,” he says, amid a conclusion that will likely haunt Drake’s nightmares for years. “I’ve stumbled and lived every word, was I working just way too hard?” There is disappointment in his voice, and some bitterness. André’s disillusionment could be a cautionary tale for Frank, who often uses the album as an opportunity to look back with a rosy tint: climbing trees, Michael Jackson, cannonballs off the porch, Stevie Wonder. It makes sense for an artist who titled his first major project Nostalgia, Ultra. when he was only 23. Longing looks good on him, though, especially when he’s able to harness it to aching effect on “Self Control” and “White Ferrari,” songs that fight off despondency with a sadness that feels three-dimensional. The album ends with a final look in the rearview, in the form of spliced-up old interviews with some of Frank’s young friends as well as his brother Ryan, who was around 11 at the time. A cozy keyboard rolls in the background as the boys talk about who they are and what they wish for. Carefree laughs—the kind that adults can’t seem to utter—are looped. Harsh static constantly intrudes, though, hinting at the distortions of time. These brief talks are also transcribed in the magazine alongside photos, and when asked about his dream superpowers, Ryan says, “I want to be invisible, I want to fly, and I want to be invincible.” His bright eyes peer out from under a Supreme cap and pink bandana. He looks like he might pull it all off.",["http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/23692/homepage_large.5f06f7f6.jpg","http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/23693/homepage_large.f859bdf2.jpg","http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/23692/homepage_small.5f06f7f6.jpg","http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/23693/homepage_small.f859bdf2.jpg"]]

Gucci dropped Everybody Looking in July, with features from Drake, Kanye West and Young Thug, and will be back in less than a month’s time with Woptober, scheduled to drop on Oct. 17, or 1017, in the fashion of his record label. Keeping things somewhat consistent, the new Gucci album will likewise boast three features, with Travis Scott, Rick Ross and Young Dolph all pitching in. The Scott collab, “Last Time” is the lead single and dropped in late August. Noticeably absent however are the collaborations with Lil Wayne and Outkast that Guwop referenced on Snapchat earlier this month, though at this pace Gucci will still have time to drop a third album before year’s end. Back in July, XXL caught up with Zaytoven to discuss the changes Guwop made in his artistic process since getting out of jail. “He still Gucci Mane. He still going to give you the same style of lyrics and the same charisma,” Zay said about Gucci’s approach to making Everybody Looking. “I think he came out with a clear mind and focused. Even though he’s been locked up for so long, he sat and thought about all the songs that he wrote. A lot of the time, he might come in and rap in the spirit of the moment. But he took his time and effort on [this album].” Woptober then, with the tracklist included below, could be an extension of those same processes. A preorder of the album is available via iTunes. Gucci Mane’s Woptober Tracklist 1. “Intro: F*** 12” 2. “Aggressive” 3. “The Left” 4. “Money Machine” Feat. Rick Ross 5. “Dirty Lil N****” 6. “Last Time” Feat.

Today, a representative for Bowie has confirmed to Pitchfork that no samples were cleared for the release, and the pair didn’t work together. The rep, who speculates Frank probably credited Bowie as an influence, did share a full-page photo tribute that appeared in the magazine. You can see that below. Other listed contributors included Elliott Smith, whose “Fond Farewell” chorus was interpolated for “Seigfried,” and the Beatles, whose “Here, There and Everywhere” Frank quotes in “White Ferrari.” See where David Bowie’s songs placed on our new list “The 200 Best Songs of the 1970s.” Read “Frank Ocean’s Boys Don’t Cry: A Timeline,” and our conversation with Ocean collaborator Wolfgang Tillmans about how his song “Device Control” became a part of Endless.  Artists In This Story David Bowie Frank Ocean",["http://cdn.pitchfork.com/news/67760/c0042f76.jpg","http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/Screen%20Shot%202016-08-24%20at%2013.11.01%20%281%29.png"]]

This past weekend, at the taping of the 2016 BET Hip Hop Awards, producer and frequent Future collaborator Zaytoven, who produced all of Beast Mode and will look to do the same for its follow-up, spilled some details on what fans can expect from the project’s first offering. “We should be dropping a single within two weeks,” he said, “and it’s featuring Drake.” Future and Drake, who released their joint album What a Time to Be Alive in September of 2015, just wrapped up their Summer Sixteen tour this past weekend, so if an extended week in Atlanta produced an entire album, imagine what three months on the road together could yield. For Future, a return to the Beast Mode series is not only a reunion with Zay, but an effort to recapture some of the magic that the rapper displayed over a dizzying five month span in which he released three mixtapes, each earning its own critical acclaim. 56 Nights yielded “March Madness” and Monster gave us “Fuck Up Some Commas.” Beast Mode meanwhile included “Real Sisters.” While a release date for Beast Mode 16 isn’t yet available, Zaytoven’s comments effectively raise anticipation for the project, with Drake himself saying he’s got six or seven new tracks recorded himself. 34 Rappers Going Platinum in 2016 Image of Subscribe to XXL on Filed Under: Drake | Future Category: News SHARE TWEET EMAIL REDDIT More Leave a comment EMAIL Print this page Pin it!

Check out the full list of contributors below via Twitter—while the song-by-song credits have not been released, André 3000 can be heard doing a verse on “Solo (Reprise).” Lyrics from Elliott Smith’s “A Fond Farewell” and the Beatles’ “Here, There, and Everywhere” appear to be featured in “Seigfried” and “White Ferrari,” respectively.

Two days later, there was another one. Blond, the official follow-up to Ocean’s magnificent, bar-raising opus Channel Orange, is the album listeners have been anxiously anticipating after many delays and rumored release dates, and it’s ready to be unpacked. Led by the track “Nikes,” which arrived only hours before the album with a Tyrone Lebon-directed video, its expectations were somewhat diffused by the earlier release of the visual album and companion piece Endless. But the pressure was still on, brought on in part by the stellar debut but also by the colossal weight of hype; as Ocean noted in a Tumblr post after the release: “thank you all. Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish. Which is basically every one of ya’ll.” A 17-track offering, Blond builds on Ocean’s reputation as a songwriter and auteur of the highest order, enlisting assistance from creatives across the musical spectrum. It's almost all material we've never heard, with a few reworked elements from some songs debuted in Munich a few years back thrown into the mix. There are shades of Orange in its diverse sonic palette, but it is unique with its own feel and flow. Now that you can finally dive in, here are some things to consider as you listen to Blond. Meet the Crack Team of Engineers That Mixed Blond Blond sounds lush and rich, especially heard next to the comparatively lo-fi Endless. A host of experienced engineers from different backgrounds had a hand it making the album what it is. Guests James Blake and Jonny Greenwood appear to have brought engineers from recent projects with them—Sam Petts-Davies and Matt Mysko, who worked on A Moon Shaped Pool and The Colour in Anything, respectively. The legendary Bob Ludwig, who has worked on records for Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Jimi Hendrix, and Nirvana, among many others, had a role on Blond. Sean Oakley and Jason Lader, who were also credited on The Colour in Anything as recording engineers, are here, too. Joe Visciano, who has credits on David Bowie’s Blackstar and Jamie xx’s In Colour (both of whom are also credited on Blond), and who has mixed and assisted on records for Adele, Arcade Fire, and Shamir, is also listed as a contributor for this album. Then there’s producer extraordinaire Mike Dean (who mastered Endless) and Grammy winner Tom Elmhirst, who mixed Amy Winehouse’s Back to Black, Adele’s 19 and 25, and Beck’s Morning Phase. Not to be forgotten is Channel Orange alum Jeff Ellis. Guest List: Late Icons, A-listers, and … Japanese Rappers? The Blond credits were presented as a list in the Boys Don’t Cry magazine, not in the traditional liner notes format like on the visual album, Endless, but poring over them still provides some context for this record. The list, which doesn't distinguish between sample sources and musical collaborators, also brings more questions about the record's composition. Listen closely and you may hear the flourishes of returning collaborators Malay and Om’mas Keith. But in addition to credits from some lost legends like the Beatles, Bowie, and Elliott Smith, seasoned musical sages (Brian Eno, Jonny Greenwood, and Rick Rubin), some more contemporary A-listers (Beyoncé, Pharrell, Kanye West, and Kendrick Lamar), and some artists of the “dream collaboration” variety (Arca, James Blake, Jazmine Sullivan, and Rostam Batmanglij), there are a handful of unusual guests and some straight-up unknowns. The most surprising name in the credits might be Yung Lean, the sing-songy Swedish rapper/one-time web phenom, and it’s hard to tell what exactly his input was (vocals on “Self Control,” perhaps). Gospel singer Kim Burrell, who worked alongside Kirk Franklin in the Trinity Temple Gospel Mass Choir and later founded the Love and Liberty Fellowship Church, is a vocalist on “Godspeed.” Two Japanese rappers, KOHH and Loota, are credited as guests on the CD version of “Nikes.” They are best known in the West for their features on Korean rapper Keith Ape’s viral hit “It G Ma.” Producer Benjamin Wright also joins the fray. In his four-decade long career he’s done everything from arranging synths for the Temptations in the ’80s to arranging strings on Michael Jackson’s “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough” and “Rock with You” to conducting on Justin Timberlake’s Justified and OutKast’s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. Perhaps he had something to do with the gorgeous, streaking violins on “Pink + White.” Nigerian-American producer Michael Uzowuru, who is credited on both albums (he co-produced the Endless standout “Rushes to”), has been Odd Future-adjacent since 2010. He’s produced tracks for Earl Sweatshirt, Domo Genesis, Jet Age of Tomorrow, and Vince Staples, so it's no shock to see him here. Then there’s SebastiAn, the French electronic musician who has kept fans waiting for an album even longer than Ocean has (Total came out in 2011), the teller on “Facebook Story,” posing the same questions about connectivity that the Endless song “Device Control” does. There Are Guitars Galore Between Jonny Greenwood, Amber Coffman, Rostam Batmanglij, the mysteriously-billed Space Man (who played on three Endless tracks, including “Rushes”—Pitchfork has confirmed that this is not J. Spaceman of Spiritualized and Spacemen 3), Andre 3000 (who appeared on Channel Orange), Mike Dean (a noted guitarist and bassist), Buddy Ross (who played bass on “Florida” from Endless), Malay, and Frank himself, you’d figure there would be a heavy dose of guitar on this release. But the scope of the instrument’s involvement is even grander than expected. Guitar dominates the record. The dream poppy sparkle on “Ivy;” the more subdued, reverb-tinged flutter on “Skyline To;” the plucky, acoustic flicks on “Self Control;” the punkish amp overload that jumpstarts “Pretty Sweet” before bottoming out into something more sweeping with piano fills; the mashing jingle at the open of “Nights” and the electric fret walk at its close. Blond moves and swells in these moments, which help anchor Ocean’s voice and his writing. “I Got Two Versions. I Got Twooo Versions” Speculation about a Channel Orange follow-up first took off with a Tumblr post, which seemed to imply that there would be an album and a magazine, both called Boys Don’t Cry, and that both would be released that July. Now, it seems that caption could mean several things. Could the two versions be the two different albums: Endless and Blond? Could the two versions be two different version of Blond itself? The CD released at the pop-up shop and the version in Apple Music have different tracklists. (Web sleuths suggest the songs on the disc feature the same recordings from the digital version.) The image on the post depicts two different magazines, which could mean there’s another out there. (It could also just mean Ocean decided to go with a different variant of that cover since one had “2015” on it, though the issue of Boys Don’t Cry released for free at the pop-up shops had three alternate covers.) There’s also the very real possibility that the various projects and release plans changed along the way and came together with a certain amount of improvisation, which leaves a lot of loose ends (like the fact that Apple Music calls the album Blonde instead of Blond). Watching the Throne? Frank's features on Jay Z and Kanye West’s big-budget swag rap pageant Watch the Throne helped introduce him to the world, but a couple of things about Blond run counter to the interests of the rap moguls. Through his Adidas partnership and Yeezy collection, Kanye has waged a personal fashion holy war against Nike and its subsidiary brand Jordans, taking shots on record and in tweets. Ocean rolled his album out with a song called “Nikes.” Jay Z and his polished but supremely under-gunned streaming service Tidal are in the throes of a battle for market share with giants Spotify and Apple Music. Tidal largely relies on exclusive streaming rights to high profile releases to woo and maintain its subscribers (See: Beyonce’s Lemonade and Rihanna’s ANTI), and nabbing the Frank Ocean album would’ve been a notch in his belt. Considering the close relationship between the two, it seemed all but a foregone conclusion at one point (when Tidal first launched, many speculated that the Channel Orange follow-up might be one of the first Tidal exclusives). But Ocean granted exclusive streaming rights with top competitor Apple instead. At the very least, these are funny coincidences. Welcome to Frank’s Multimedia Experience Fans have been wondering what Frank Ocean has been up to in the four years since Channel Orange, and the answer seems to be: creating a fully-immersive, multimedia experience. First there was the live stream, which initially seemed like a tease (and later a troll), but turned out to be a cryptic lesson on respecting creative space. Then the visual album followed, Endless, an extension of the live stream (visually speaking) that dubbed the odds and ends from the Blond sessions over literal work in progress (several songs debuted on the live stream in the hours leading up to the official release, as Ocean built his staircase). After that, we got the long-teased magazine, Boys Don’t Cry, which he released for free at pop-up shops, and which includes interviews with Katonya Breaux (his mother) and Lil B, a rap from Kanye West about McDonald’s, photos from Wolfgang Tillmans, and an emotional poem Frank wrote called “Boyfriend.” Now, there’s Blond, the full-bodied, finely-tuned follow-up we’ve been waiting for, a storyboard to consume and unpack. The full package explores Ocean’s creative range. It brings to mind a tweet of his from long ago, back when he was still on Twitter, not long after he’d released Channel Orange and before he’d withdrawn from the public eye: “If you’re a writer you can write anything..prose, songs, raps, novels, plays, films, laws..take the governor off your gift. Note to self.” It seems he’s heeded that advice and was willing to share. We just had to be patient.

The personal narrative Christopher Breaux has composed around his art—the deeply moving coming-out letter on the eve of Channel Orange, and now the giddy, long-withheld surprise of not one, but two new album-length projects—suggests he could do it. But the form Ocean has especially mastered is the short story. Remember the sex-and-numbness-at-Coachella tale of “Novacane,” from 2011 mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra, or the vividly rendered taxicab confessional of “Bad Religion.” Add to that list “Ivy,” the second track on Blonde and the first that begins with Ocean singing in his usual register. Like “Thinkin Bout You” or the looser, cloudier “Rushes,” a highlight from last week’s Endless visual album, here Ocean reflects poignantly on youth, love, and sex. “I thought that I was dreaming/When you said you love me,” he repeats, addressing someone whose heart the narrator evidently broke—“It’s all right to hate me”—but affirming the relationship was still worthwhile, “the feeling still deep down is good.” The lyrics refer back to and build on themselves, so the emotional payoff is all the more powerful. A detailed contributor list for Blonde is still emerging, but whether Endless-credited guest Alex G plays on this song or not, “Ivy” is a percussion-less guitar-pop reverie, with palm-muted power chords doused in crystalline tones that emphasize Ocean’s word—“dreaming.” (No less than Rostam Batmanglij wrote the guitar part for the song, Pitchfork has learned.) Alex G’s warped yet tuneful, homemade-sounding indie rock bears an uncanny stamp on Blonde, but Ocean sets “Ivy” apart from other intimate strummers with the sheer force of his voice. Not shying away from comparisons to the late Prince, he ends “Ivy” by unleashing a high-pitched squeal: “Dreamin’!” Then it’s on to the next story in the collection, the next waking dream, the next defiantly multidimensional vision of himself.",["http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/tracks/18496/100000x100000-999 10.42.45 AM copy.jpg","http://cdn.pitchfork.com/artists/29508/sm.07636465.jpg","http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/tracks/18496/100000x100000-999 10.42.45 AM copy.jpg"]]

(A visual album? Album album? Album teaser?) It’s tough to know what these songs are meant to be. They could be doodles from his sketchbook, they could be unvarnished cris de coeur. But “Rushes” drifts daringly far from any music Frank Ocean has ever made before. The sound on Channel Orange was mostly friendly, plush, sunny, with rich keyboard chords and rounded, warm thumps of drums like two beach floats gently colliding. On “Rushes,” Ocean’s voice rings out from a cavernous echo, as if the house from “Super Rich Kids” has been foreclosed and the kids, now older, sit forlornly in the drained pool. There is a guitar somewhere in the mix—played by bedroom-pop Orchid Tapes affiliate Alex G, of all people—and it is a murmuring, vaporous sound behind Ocean’s high, thin voice. “Tell me what you need from me/Gas money,” he sings, the lyrics blurred. “Infatuation’s a rush.” Howling back-up singers, so faraway they sound like an arranger’s idea of background singers to be hired later, enter. The song has a purposefully fragmented feeling, similar to The Life of Pablo’s “Father Stretch My Hands,” where torn-off song pieces were tossed in the air, like colorful scarves, and allowed to hang near each other instead of stitched together. All of these inchoate elements sound, at first, like a very talented person’s soon-to-be-finished demo. Then something clear and sharp happens: A drum track, its hi-hats clipping into the red, sputters to life, and the song is suddenly tootling away from you, a rusted old European motorcycle rounding a bend and out of sight. Whatever else Frank is doing right now—suffering from nerves, purposefully stoking excitement, indulging in old-fashioned perfectionism, etc.—his music continues to make his case for him. Watch Endless at Apple Music.",["http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/tracks/18494/tumblr_oc52fhVpCW1va3yt4o1_1280 copy.jpg","http://cdn.pitchfork.com/artists/29508/sm.07636465.jpg","http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/tracks/18494/tumblr_oc52fhVpCW1va3yt4o1_1280 copy.jpg"]]

The Walkman! Karaoke! Looking back at the ’70s innovations that shaped how people created and listened to music throughout the decade and beyond. Illustrations by Jojo Sounthone by Marc HoganSenior Staff Writer Lists & Guides Rock Global Pop/R&B ElectronicAugust 25 2016 The history of music is inseparable from the history of technology. From the first primitive percussion instruments, catgut strings, and animal horns, to Thomas Edison’s phonograph and the jukebox, how we listen and create has evolved with the tools of the times. By the 1950s and 1960s, the technological conditions were ripe for the birth of popular music as it’s often idealized today, with AM and FM radio going mainstream, vinyl records supplanting the earlier shellac format, and multi-track recording developments clearing the way for late-’60s studio experimentation. But in many ways, it was the 1970s marked the dawn of the modern era in music technology, applying and refining the developments of earlier decades while also laying the foundations of the techniques and styles that would follow. If it exists today, there’s a good chance it could be considered ’70s retro. The first half of the decade could be seen as an extension of the ’60s, as previously invented gadgets—multi-track and cassette tapes, synths and vocoders, car stereos and wah-wah pedals—continued to be honed. Eventually, though, new technological advances set the stage for CDs, pocket-sized digital music players, and even entire genres, like hip-hop and techno, which would reverberate well into the 21st century. 1970 24-Track Recording Multi-track recording, which offers the ability to record multiple performances separately and at different times, reached new levels of complexity in the ’70s. As late as 1966, the Beatles recorded Revolver on a four-track machine; they didn’t use eight-track recording until 1968. By 1970, 16 tracks were starting to become standard, and 24-track machines arrived. Throughout the decade and into the ’80s, 24-tracks would be the rule, not the exception. New York studio the Record Plant went 24-track in 1970, reportedly becoming the first to employ a machine made by MCI, whose gear was later used by AC/DC, Queen, Led Zeppelin, and other ’70s giants. Hi-Fi Cassette Decks The “compact cassette,” as it was called, dates to 1962, though this format trailed in music sales behind the similarly portable 8-track cartridge deep into the ’70s. Audio company Dolby developed its Dolby B noise reduction system in 1968, and the first cassette players using the technology—from Advent, Fisher, and Harman Kardon—debuted in 1970. Billed as a way to make the humble cassette sound as good as bulkier vinyl albums, the new decks helped to popularize the format. By the early ’80s, U.S. sales of albums on tape were beating vinyl LPs. Car Tape Decks Along with higher-fidelity technology, another reason for tapes’ gradual ascent was the automobile market, which was initially dominated by 8-tracks. In late 1970, Detroit automakers started installing cassette players in some of their new models, taking advantage of features including “compactness, rewind and fast forward, recording capability and automatic reverse,” per one contemporary report. Generations could now listen to their own mixtapes while breezing down the highway. Cassette decks would come factory-installed on at least some new automobiles all the way up until 2011. Quad-8 Even with cassettes on the rise, the venerable 8-track wasn’t going down without a fight. In the spring of 1970, RCA introduced quadraphonic 8-track cartridges, or Quad-8. Compatible with existing stereo 8-track players, Quad-8 offered four channels of sound—similar to a surround sound experience. This type of immersive sonic idea was having a moment around this time, from Pink Floyd’s quadraphonic 1967 live concert to the Who’s 1973 album Quadrophenia. Quad-8 failed to catch on, but surviving cartridges from Floyd, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and even Lou Reed’s infamous Metal Machine Music have been known to fetch tidy sums on eBay. The 8-track faded away, of course, but remains indelibly associated with the ’70s in popular memory. Portable Synthesizers In the late ’60s, Robert Moog pioneered the use of synthesized sounds in music with the innovation of his influential Moog synth. In 1970, he introduced the Minimoog, which was touted to be “the size of an electric office typewriter.” The compact instrument stopped being produced in 1981, but it can be heard on records by Parliament-Funkadelic, Kraftwerk, Gary Numan, Bob Marley, Michael Jackson, Dr. Dre, Devo, and more. Other companies soon followed suit with their own portable synths, such as the ARP Odyssey, which was used by Herbie Hancock, Kraftwerk, and Yellow Magic Orchestra. In 2016, the classic Minimoog Model D returned to production. Fender Rhodes Stage Piano Inventor Harold Rhodes introduced his Fender Rhodes electric piano in 1965, but it wasn’t until 1970 that musicians could buy the more easily transportable Stage Piano model. From there, the bright Rhodes tone became omnipresent during the decade, heard all over records by Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock, the Doors, and Steely Dan. By the ’90s, neo-soul artists like D’Angelo and Erykah Badu revived the instrument’s signature warm sound, which still looms large on recent records by artists including Floating Points and BADBADNOTGOOD.   Mellotron Originally developed in 1963 in the UK, the Mellotron was an early type of sampler keyboard that produced its sounds using prerecorded tape loops. Sonically, it also added a bit of an eerie flutter, as heard in the introduction to the Beatles’ 1967 single “Strawberry Fields Forever.” The most common Mellotron, the lighter-weight Model 400, arrived in 1970, and the instrument spread throughout the decade to bands like Genesis and Tangerine Dream. Better technology overtook the Mellotron, but Oasis and Radiohead brought it back into focus in late ’90s. Now, there’s an app for that. Large-Scale Live Sound In 1965, when the Beatles performed at New York’s Shea Stadium, their music went through the same public address system used by the ballpark announcer; little wonder they quit touring afterward. After that, though, various innovations helped boost live sound. But it was a Grateful Dead show on February 2, 1970, at the Fox Theater in St. Louis, Missouri, that’s credited with birthing large-scale live sound systems as they came to be known. When the Dead’s touring sound mixer (and ’60s LSD pioneer) Augustus Owsley Stanley III was arrested after a show in New Orleans, the Fox put Jerry Garcia in touch with nearby audio guru Bob Heil, and the massive sound system he delivered led the Dead to take him and his gear on tour. Heil went on to hand-build systems for the Who and others, and concertgoers grew accustomed to actually being able to hear a band’s music onstage. 1971  Karaoke It’s almost hard to believe that karaoke didn’t just always exist. But it too had to be invented, and Japan’s Daisuke Inoue is generally credited for doing just that. As the legend goes, Inoue was working a nightclub, accompanying businessmen who wanted to sing, when one executive asked him to come along and back up his warbling on an out-of-town trip. Inoue couldn’t leave his regular gig, so he shared a tape of his instrumental. Later that year, Inoue built the first machines for karaoke, which translates to “empty orchestra.” The relationship between music fans and the songs they love has never been quite the same since. Vocoders as Musical Instruments The vocoder—essentially, a synthesizer that analyzes speech and electronically recreates it—has a long and fascinating history that dates back to Bell Labs in 1928 and runs through World War II. As early as 1967, the vocoder could be heard in song on Alvin Lucier’s “North American Time Capsule,” though it’s doubtful how many listeners would have discovered it. Wendy Carlos, an early proponent of the Moog synthesizer with her 1968 LP Switched-On Bach, later worked with Moog on a prototype vocoder. Carlos’ use of a Beethoven vocoder in the soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick’s 1971 film A Clockwork Orange, accompanying scenes of record-shopping, a fast-paced orgy, and cruelty, introduced the vocoder’s musical capabilities to a wide audience. Not to be confused with the similar but distinct “talk box,” which applies speech sounds to an instrument rather than a synth, the vocoder would feature in the next decade on music by acts like Kraftwerk, Electric Light Orchestra, Giorgio Moroder, and Pink Floyd. By the ’80s, Phil Collins and Neil Young were getting in on the act. Despite the proliferation of the different but like-minded Auto-Tune effect heard on Cher’s “Believe” or T-Pain’s hits, groups like Daft Punk have kept the vocoder sound alive well into the 21st century. Wah-Wah Gets Funky The musical idea behind the wah-wah pedal, which changes the tone of an electric guitar’s signal, is as old as the trumpet and trombone mutes it was meant to emulate. The pedal, however, achieves this crying tone electronically. Although Chet Atkins and others had experimented with similar devices, the modern wah pedal arose in 1966, somewhat by mistake, thanks to engineer Brad Plunkett and California’s Thomas Organ Company. In the late-’60s the pedal was associated with psychedelia via famous records by Jimi Hendrix and Cream, but Hendrix’s percussive use of the wah effect on 1967’s “Little Miss Lover” pointed another way forward. The guitarist Charlie Pitts popularized the now-familiar “wacka-wacka” technique for “wah” on Isaac Hayes’ Academy Award-winning “Theme from Shaft,” and this funkier wah style only spread from there. Plus, no account of the wah in the ’70s would be complete without acknowledging Miles Davis’ embrace of it, including for his own trumpet, on albums like 1971’s Live Evil, 1972’s On the Corner, and 1975’s Agharta. Digital Delay The early ’70s was also when the music industry could begin to dream up its digital future. In 1971, Massachusetts-based Lexicon produced its Delta T-101 digital delay line, later described as “a significant breakthrough—the seminal product of what would within a decade become a digital industry.” By 1978, the same company introduced an early digital reverb system. Though nostalgia remains for the old analog ways, these developments foreshadowed how digital signal processing, whether with computers or increasingly elaborate effects pedals, would redesign the sound of the decades to come. TONTO In the late ’60s, Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff amassed and integrated a variety of different synths to create what they called The Original New Timbral Orchestra, or TONTO—“one of the first synthesizers capable of producing many tone colors with different voices simultaneously,” according to Calgary’s National Music Centre, which acquired TONTO in 2013. In 1971, the public got to hear TONTO for the first time on Cecil and Margouleff’s debut LP under the name Tonto’s Expanding Head Band. It wouldn’t be the last: TONTO featured on classic Stevie Wonder’s ’70s albums like Music of My Mind, Talking Book, and Innervisions, as well as on records by Quincy Jones, the Isley Brothers, and Gil Scott-Heron, who put TONTO on the cover of his 1980 LP. The machine also appeared in Brian de Palma’s cult classic 1974 movie Phantom of the Paradise, which later proved to be a formative inspiration for Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, aka Daft Punk. 1972 King Tubby’s Mixing Desk In the ’60s, a former electronics repairman in Jamaica named Osbourne Ruddock formed a sound system, dubbed King Tubby’s Hi-Fi, which rose to prominence amid a culture where DJ setups took precedence over live performances. King Tubby also had a small studio at his home in Kingston, where he would dramatically remix four-track recordings that were brought to him—inventing dub in the process. In 1972, producer Bunny Lee set up King Tubby’s purchase of an old MCI mixing desk, which gave him access to the high-pass filter, reverb, and delay that would help dub inspire post-punk, hip-hop, and techno. Mu-Tron III This fixture of funk started with a simple idea: a product that could make synthesizer-like sounds using various electric instruments. When New Jersey’s Musitronics Corp. launched the resulting effects pedal, Mu-Tron III, in 1972, the device led to a new class of “envelope filter” or “auto-wah” pedals. As the latter name implies, the Mu-Tron III is a relative of the wah-wah effect, applying a “vowel-like” sound to whatever tones are being played. But this particular gear is most famous for its ties to Stevie Wonder, who used it on his clavinet for Innervisions’ “Higher Ground”—and even endorsed the pedal in an ad. “Dry-as-a-Bone Sound” Once more tracks were available in the studio, recording engineers found new ways to use them. Many started to put microphones close to instruments, rather than capturing full-room sound, and sequestered musicians in separate rooms. “They wanted to eliminate leakage, so that every track was a discrete puzzle piece that they could swap in and out of the final mix or run through various processors to shape the sound,” as Greg Milner writes in his history of recording, Perfecting Sound Forever. This “dry” sound was most common on records by West Coast groups like the Eagles and Steely Dan, but it’s also evident in the straightforward rock of AC/DC or ZZ Top. 1973 The Heil Talk Box Bob Heil, the same speaker wizard who reinvented live sound for the Grateful Dead and the Who, also popularized the talk box, a gadget that lets musicians essentially run the sound of their voices through their instruments (to quote “The Simpsons,” “Man, that guy’s guitar is talking!”). He first built his talk box for Joe Walsh in the early ’70s, then gave the commercial version to Peter Frampton as a Christmas gift. Frampton’s use of it on his blockbuster album Frampton Comes Alive! linked him to the device forevermore. 1974 The 12\" Dance Single A “Tom Moulton Mix” is a certificate of quality on ’70s disco singles. But the hugely influential producer also effectively invented the format on which those songs are pressed. According to lore, Moulton was cutting an acetate reference disc—a type of one-off test pressing—for Al Downing’s “I’ll Be Holding On,” when the mastering engineer, José Rodriguez, ran out of blank 7\" discs. Reports differ on whether the acetate Rodriguez used instead was 12 inches or, less poetically, 10 inches. Either way, Moulton thought it would look better if Rodriguez spread the grooves out across the entire record, which had the side effect of creating a massive sound that was ideal for club DJs. The 12\" single quickly became the norm for dance music, but Moulton’s place in music history would already have been assured: He’s also widely considered the father of the extended dance remix and the continuous dance mix. 1975 Polymoog As synthesizers got more portable in the early ’70s, they still generally couldn’t play more than one or two notes at a time. But in 1975, Moog introduced the Polymoog, an early polyphonic synth with 71 keys that eventually earned its place in synth-pop history by featuring prominently on Gary Numan’s 1979 hit “Cars.” The Polymoog also appeared a year earlier in the string-like tones on Blondie’s “Heart of Glass.” Other polyphonic synths took over later in the decade, including the Yamaha CS-80 (1976), Oberheim's Polyphonic and OBX, Sequential Circuits’ Prophet-5, and Roland’s Jupiter 4. The credits to Prince’s debut LP, 1978’s For You, cite a “Ms. Poly Moog.” Component Car Stereos As drivers got used to listening to their favorite music on car cassette decks, an opening emerged for more expensive car speaker systems. Pioneer Electronics claims to have debuted the first component car stereo system in 1975. A component system separates the woofers (midrange frequencies) and tweeters (treble frequencies), ideally resulting in better sound. Subwoofers, with their rattling low-end, were a logical next step.   1976 The VCR Musical short films are about as old as movies with sound, so it’s only fitting that the rise of music videos coincided with the rise of home video. In 1976, JVC rolled out the first VHS-based video cassette recorder, the JVC HR-3300. As music videos gained popularity after the launch of MTV in 1981, viewers could not only record their favorite music to check out later, but also buy pre-recorded VHS tapes featuring video stars. And many did: Moonwalker, a 1989 Michael Jackson video compilation, went multi-platinum, and 1983’s Making Michael Jackson’s Thriller—the first music video to top top Billboard’s video sales chart—logged eight weeks at #1. DVDs followed, of course, and now YouTube has mostly rendered those old VHS tapes obsolete, but the basic technology for most people to watch music videos began here. 1977 Synclavier By the late ’70s, new types of synthesizers were evolving at a breathtaking rate. Developed at Dartmouth and introduced in 1977 by the newly formed New England Digital Corporation, the Synclavier was an early digital synthesizer that grew increasingly sophisticated into the ’80s, with digital sampling and other features meant to achieve a cohesive “tapeless studio.” Over the next decade, the Synclavier would loom large on hits by a veritable who’s who of the era’s big acts, including a gong preset that bangs at the start of Thriller’s “Beat It.” Commercial Digital Recording The technology behind digital audio recording, like the vocoder, dated back to World War II. And as digital alternatives to analog began developing in other areas of music production, digital recording also arose as a possibility. As early as 1971, Japanese electronics company Denon was making early digital recordings that saw commercial release. The Sony PCM-1, regarded as the first commercially available digital recording system, arrived in 1977, using a home VCR as a storage medium. The same year brought the first digitally recorded U.S. albums for commercial release. By 1979, Ry Cooder would release a digitally recorded pop album, Bop Till You Drop, and Stevie Wonder went digital with Stevie Wonder’s Journey Through “The Secret Life of Plants.” The Modern Stratocaster Although Fender’s signature Stratocaster guitar—made famous by Jimi Hendrix—was more popular than ever before in the ’70s, “the new ones weren’t nearly as good as the older ones,” according to an article on Fender’s own website. On top of that, Fender continued to make minor cosmetic tweaks to the Strat. In 1977, 23 years after the Stratocaster first hit the market, Fender went so far as to swap out the old three-position pickup selector switch for a five-position switch, a design overhaul that endures to this day. Though this particular change merely acknowledged how guitarists were using the instrument anyway, it roughly coincided with the advent of a vintage guitar market. The Power Station Plenty of producers and musicians questioned the arid, close-mic’d ’70s production style. New Jersey native Tony Bongiovi, who got his start at age 17 working for Motown, had in idea. He envisioned a studio that would have Motown-like ambience and allow musicians to play in the same room together while avoiding too much overlap between mics. By the time Bongiovi opened the Power Station, in an old midtown Manhattan ConEd plant, he was an established producer who’d worked with Gloria Gaynor, Al Downing, the Ramones, and Talking Heads. The studio’s purposefully live-like setting led to vibrant, resounding records including Chic’s C’est Chic and Risque, Bruce Springsteen’s The River and Born in the U.S.A., David Bowie’s Let’s Dance, and Madonna’s Like a Virgin. Pink Floyd’s Flying Pigs While Bob Heil had been breaking ground for large-scale live sound at U.S. concerts, Pink Floyd had put on similarly pioneering UK shows, dating back to their first quadraphonic gig in 1967. The band had been similarly busy with the visual aspect of their performances, from psychedelic light shows to pyrotechnics and giant inflatables. But nothing remains so synonymous with the band’s ’70s spectacle though as the oversized inflatable pigs introduced during their tour for 1977’s Animals. It typified a more general turn toward pyrotechnics, balloons, and props popularized in ’70s concerts by bands like Queen and Kiss. Roland MC-8 Microcomposer As synthesizers blossomed in complexity, some started to incorporate the features of primitive computers. In 1978, Japanese electronic instrument maker Roland’s MC-8 Microcomposer, though manufactured only in small numbers, hinted at the power microchips would have on music. This instrument used an Intel 8080A 8-bit microprocessor and 16KB of random access memory—plus a calculator-like keypad. One of the first users was Ryuichi Sakamoto and his Yellow Magic Orchestra; other early adopters were Landscape’s Richard James Burgess and John Walters, who went on to lend their synth wizardry to revered ’80s albums by Kate Bush. 1978 FM Radio Dominance FM radio broadcasts go back to the 1930s, and by the end of the ’60s, they became known for freeform and progressive sounds, which led into the album-oriented rock (AOR) format. FM meant higher fidelity and less static, a boon for actively listening to music. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when FM overtook AM in North America, but a commonly noted turning point is 1978, when FM stations first accounted for a majority of the top 10 stations in the top 50 market. Roland CR-78 Drum Machine Preset drum machines, which offered only factory-programmed patterns, had been around since the ’60s. And as programming drum machines arose in the ’70s, Roland’s CR-78, launched in 1978, caught on with acts like Blondie. The most famous drum machines, such as the Roland TR-808 and the Linn LM-1 Drum Computer, wouldn’t arrive until 1980. The Townhouse The Power Station in the New York wasn’t the only studio bringing back a sense of live room ambience as the ’70s became the ’80s. In 1978, Virgin Records mogul Richard Branson built a London studio called the Townhouse, which consisted of one traditionally sound-proofed room and a separate space decked out with reverberant stone slabs. The Townhouse bought one of the first consoles built by a then-small British company called Solid State Logic. In 1980, Townhouse engineer Hugh Padgham was working on Peter Gabriel’s third solo album when he discovered a quirk of the SSL console that produced a huge, crashing sound from drummer Phil Collins. Padgham soon co-produced Collins’ 1981 hit “In the Air Tonight,” and that mix of the SSL’s compression, a CR78 drum machine, and Townhouse’s unique studio gave birth to the soon-ubiquitous ’80s gated drum sound. 1979 Fairlight CMI Introduced in 1979, the Fairlight Computer Musical Instrument was more than just another digital synthesizer. It was also a digital sampler. By the 1990s and 2000s, the same functionality would be available on a cheap home computer, but back then it was enough for the Fairlight to be adopted far and wide. Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones reportedly bought the first CMI, followed by the likes of Kate Bush, Trevor Horn, Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock, Jann Hammer, and Joni Mitchell. The liner notes to Phil Collins’ No Jacket Required, in 1985, state, “There is no Fairlight on this record”; in other words, the horns you hear on the album are performed, not sampled. The CMI’s success made that something to brag about. Tascam Portastudio It’s important to note that the spread of umpteen-track recording in the ’70s was limited to proper recording studios. But Tascam made reel-to-reel tape machines and mixers for musicians recording at home. In 1979, the company made home recording more available than ever before with the Tascam Portastudio, considered the first four-track recorder using standard cassette tapes. Today, recording is easy on a phone or a computer, but the immediacy of the Portastudio and other machines soon led to their use by not only Bruce Springsteen, on his 1982 album Nebraska, but also indie rockers like Guided by Voices and Panda Bear, rappers from Wu-Tang Clan to Madlib, and far beyond. Sony Walkman As the ’70s progressed, listeners couldn’t yet conveniently bring their music with them, as it’s so easy to take for granted today. Then, in 1979, the original Sony Walkman went on sale in Japan, changing the culture of music listening. After being replaced by portable CD players, the iPod, and smartphones, Sony resurrected the Walkman brand last year as, what else, a high-end digital audio device. Technics SL-1200MK2 Turntable In 1970, Japanese electronics brand Panasonic introduced the Technics SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable, which means the platter for the records sits directly on top of the motor as opposed to being attached to the motor via an elastic belt. Two years later, the SL-1200 line debuted. It wasn’t until 1979, though, that the iconic Technics SL-1200MK2, with sliding pitch adjustment and all the other features that endeared it to DJs, finally arrived. The advertisements read: “Tough enough to take the disco beat.” Beyond disco, the “wheels of steel” caught on with pioneering hip-hop DJs; Grandmaster Flash’s Technics deck is now in the Smithsonian. Though Panasonic discontinued the original Technics turntable line in 2010, it recently revived the Technics 1200 as—déjà vu?—a high-end model. Compact Discs “Perfect sound forever” was just around the corner. In 1977, Sony and other manufacturers showed off prototypes for digital audio discs at the Tokyo Audio Fair. But at that point, they were about the size of a vinyl LP. On March 8, 1979, Dutch company Philips first demonstrated its smaller, 11.5 cm-diameter compact disc prototype to journalists. A 1979 Newsweek report was prescient: “The real boom won’t begin until total digital systems and components invade the home—probably sometime in the mid-1980s. Then, a digital playback device will employ a tiny laser to ‘read’ a digital recording...” Downloads—let alone streaming—weren’t yet a glimmer in the industry’s eye. Except... Early Concept for an iPod In 1979, a British inventor named Kane Kramer reportedly came up with the idea for a portable, memory chip-based digital music player that would be the size of a cigarette packet. He envisioned recordings being kept on a main server and distributed to record stores via telephone line. His pitch to investors cited “immediacy of delivery,” “no physical inventory and therefore no production costs,” and “instant micro-billing, handled centrally.” The patent lapsed, as Kramer later explained to The Guardian. But even before the ’70s were over, he had uncannily predicted much of what Apple would unveil, with great fanfare, in the early 2000s. The future was already looking retro.

More specifically, my research goals are focused on studying and addressing the challenges that emerged with the information age. With these goals in mind, my current research is focused on addressing the challenges stemming from the high volume, velocity, and variety of digital information. Research questions include how to capture, curate, store, search, share, analyze and visualize the digital information in order to support the user needs. Most recently I have been investigating approaches for the curation and preservation of digital assets and addressing the challenges associated with the long term accessibility of these assets. I have also worked on the algorithms to reduce information overload problem. In particular, I have been exploring various recommendation techniques like content-based, knowledge-based, and collaborative filtering methods to over this problem. I am interested in studying how information retrieval techniques and, more specifically, recommender systems impact individuals and organizations. Another branch of this research stream, related to my dissertation work, focuses on optimization techniques for information retrieval systems. I worked on web caching and pre-fetching techniques to improve the performance of recommender systems. Active semantic caching techniques are an extension of the caching model whereby estimation is used to generate an answer for queries whose results are not explicitly cached. Estimation makes use of the results cached for related queries. This solution utilizes query semantics and substantially extends the performance of traditional caches by placing the cache in a limited query processing role. In the future, I plan to extend my research to investigate similar optimization technique for other information retrieval systems. Performance of applications like search engines, voice recognition, face detection etc. can be significantly improved using a similar approach. Most recently I have conducted research in the area of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), their applications and their data management aspect. I am interested in investigating the possibility of re-using cached data for minimizing data traffic in the WSNs. I also have an interest in solving data mining problems and providing business intelligence to organizations by combining techniques from machine learning, statistics, and databases. In general, I am interested in conducting research in the areas such as wireless sensor networks, information retrieval, information filtering, digital preservation, human/computer interaction, data management, user behavior, digital libraries and performance optimization. My diverse academic background and professional experience has prepared me well to adapt to the myriad challenges of this field, and I have a determination to excel in these exciting areas of research.

MooreContributor Pop/R&BJanuary 11 2016 The West Coast-based rapper and singer/songwriter Anderson .Paak showed up frequently on Dr. Dre’s Compton. His third album, his most assured and most personal project yet, is informed by voices from the past and full of guests (the Game, ScHoolboy Q, Talib Kweli) who are given ample space to do their best work. Malibu is an expansive opus that flows in multiple directions like a classic '70s double album. Find it at:Amoeba Music Featured Tracks: \"Room in Here\" [ft. The Game and Sonyae Elise] — Anderson .PaakVia SoundCloud \"The Season / Carry Me\" — Anderson .PaakVia SoundCloud It doesn’t take long to reach the heart of Anderson .Paak’s new album, Malibu. Just a minute into opening track \"The Birds,\" the West Coast-based rapper and singer/songwriter offers: \"My mama caught the gambling bug... My papa was behind them bars/ We never had to want for nuthin’/ Said all we ever need is love.\" His voice is warm, strained, and conversational, like a Baptist minister or your favorite uncle schooling you, and the wide-open groove has an unhurried feel. It's immediately clear: This is a sincere, soulful project, brimming with honesty and humble perseverance. Brandon Anderson Paak has seen a lot in his 29 years. His mother was a farmer from South Korea, and his father served in the Air Force and later worked as a mechanic until he was sent to prison. \"I didn’t see him again until he was being buried,\" .Paak told Consequence of Sound in a 2015 interview. All of this life experience is reflected in Malibu, which is both his most assured and most personal project yet. .Paak's name is more prominent these days given his recent work on Dr. Dre’s Compton, where he appeared on six of 16 tracks, but even his sophomore album, 2014's Venice, showed flashes of brilliance. Venice was an easy listen; on Malibu, .Paak celebrates his progression by acknowledging where he’s come from, the trials he’s endured and things he’s seen. \"I spent years being called out my name, living under my greatness,\" .Paak asserts on \"The Season / Carry Me,\" a shape-shifting album highlight. He grew up performing in church, and on the song’s second half, you can hear a rich gospel flair in his voice: \"Ya moms in prison, ya father need a new kidney/ Ya family’s splittin’, rivalries between siblings/ If cash ain’t king, it’s damn sure the incentive.\" Much like Kendrick Lamar, .Paak skillfully depicts his surroundings while remaining in the foreground. Kendrick's spirit feels present at many points on Malibu. .Paak's quicksilver flow on \"Your Prime\" feels teleported in directly from To Pimp a Butterfly as the music flows expansively from creamy soul harmonies to trap cadences. But .Paak is a confident and unique presence, with a strong command of style and genre as a producer and songwriter. He leapfrogs three eras in a festive suite of songs mid-album that examine heartbreak: '60s soul on \"Put Me Thru,\" club grooves on \"Am I Wrong,\" and '90s hip-hop on \"Without You.\" His musical and emotional generosity ties everything together, making Malibu an expansive opus that flows in multiple directions like a classic '70s double album.  Malibu is a community-oriented project, much like Chance the Rapper on last year's Surf, informed by voices from the past and full of guests who are given ample space to do their best work. The Game drops one of his most disarming, winning verses in a minute on \"Room in Here\"; Rapsody flows affectingly about heartache over Dilla-style boom-bap. Many songs ride out on extended breakdowns, like \"Parking Lot,\" which feels like a studio band given room to stretch.  On \"The Dreamer,\" the album’s celebratory final track, .Paak shares his success with his community, people who look like him and work to avoid similar pitfalls. \"Who cares ya daddy couldn’t be here/ Mama always kept the cable on/ I’m a product of the tube and the free lunch/ Living room, watching old reruns.\" This is powerful art, not only for people of color, but for everyone who exists beyond societal constraints. It’s for those who’ve been told they don’t quite fit, those viewed through a different lens because of their circumstances. It’s a beautiful reminder that, no matter what you’ve endured, you can go anywhere and reach glorious heights.",["http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/22694/homepage_large.0e1836c9.jpg"]]

Anderson .Paak] In January, Anderson .Paak released a triumphant Kaytranada production, a track titled \"Lite Weight,\" as part of the L.A. rapper and singer/songwriter's outstanding Malibu LP. On that song, the Montreal beatmaker set the Dr. Dre affiliate's sing-song verses amid choral backing vocals and sleekly pounding electro-funk. It was a propitious meeting. .Paak is dominating every track in sight recently, not least UK duo Snakehips' similarly deft new \"Money on Me.\" Meanwhile, Kaytranda is preparing his debut album, 99.9%, featuring such worthies as AlunaGeorge, Little Dragon, BADBADNOTGOOD, Vic Mensa, and the Internet's Syd. Only a few months after .Paak and Kaytranada's Malibu collaboration comes their meeting for 99.9%, and it's even more impressive. \"Glowed Up\" is a two-part suite and a testament to both musicians' talents. The first half glides languidly, with mellow boasts, glistening synths, and the occasional spacey theremin sound over spare low-end rumble. The second half switches to percussion that's more bustling, and leans more on .Paak's gently reassuring vocals. \"Just like I wanna be, in the hands of love,\" he concludes. It's a track where two complementary artists sound like they are right where they want to be, and the pleasure is in how they bring us into this world, too—one where .Paak's \"got enough purp to last the whole damn night, yeah,\" and we get two songs for the price of one.",["http://cdn.pitchfork.com/tracks/18171/list.38b6c698.jpg","http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/artists/31672/sm.f3d2181c.jpg","http://cdn.pitchfork.com/tracks/18171/list.38b6c698.jpg"]]

Anderson Paak] 0:000:00Via SoundCloud Mac Miller finally got happy again on last year’s GO:OD AM. It wasn’t the naïve, punkish joy of his nascent mixtapes, though. The album presented a man thankful to be alive, who had rectified his mistakes and was showing his gratitude by letting all of his creativity flow. Having found his footing, Mac continues to peddle vibrancy on “Dang!” It’s a buoyant and bubbly song that features horns by Juilliard students (not to mention the unstoppable Anderson .Paak). On top of an addictive funk instrumental, Mac explores the difficult terrain of misunderstandings and confusion. He’s smitten yet losing his love’s interest. He may get frustrated but he does not blame her. Instead, he asks why. What can he do to keep her from leaving? Even the song’s title is a quiet admission that something has changed for the worse, but it’s not so insurmountable as to elicit a more negative reaction. It takes true humility to simply ask when you’re hurt. Mac Miller does that on a song that can light up a dance floor and brighten your day.",["http://cdn.pitchfork.com/tracks/18463/list.b73d282c.jpg","http://cdn.pitchfork.com/artists/30111/sm.82a13bd4.jpg","http://cdn.pitchfork.com/tracks/18463/list.b73d282c.jpg"]]

Find it at:Amoeba Music Kendrick Lamar’s major-label albums play out like Spike Lee films in miniature. In both artists’ worlds, the stakes are unbearably high, the characters’ motives are unclear, and morality is knotty, but there is a central force you can feel steering every moment. The \"Good and Bad Hair\" musical routine from Lee’s 1988 feature School Daze depicted black women grappling with colorism and exclusionary standards of American beauty. Mookie’s climactic window smash in 1989’s Do the Right Thing plunged its characters into fiery bedlam, quietly prophesying the coming L.A. riots in the process. In these moments, you could feel the director speaking to you directly through his characters and their trajectories. Lamar’s records, while crowded with conflicting ideas and arguing voices, have a similar sense of a guiding hand at work. Lamar’s new album, To Pimp a Butterfly, doesn’t explicitly bill itself as a movie like good kid, m.A.A.d city did, but the network of interlocking dramas explored here feels filmic nonetheless, and a variety of characters appear across the album’s expanse. The opener, \"Wesley’s Theory\", turns the downfall of action-star-turned-convicted-tax-dodger Wesley Snipes into a kind of Faustian parable. Snoop drops by on \"Institutionalized\"; Dre himself phones in on \"Wesley\". The mood is wry, theatrical, chaotic, ironic, and mournful, often all at once: On \"For Free? (Interlude)\" an impatient woman ticks off a laundry list of material demands before Kendrick snaps back that \"This dick ain’t free!\" and thunders through a history of black oppression, spoken-word style, as if to say, \"This money you crave, it’s blood money.\" The album is dotted with surreal grace notes, like a parable: God appears in the guise of a homeless man in \"How Much a Dollar Cost\", and closer \"Mortal Man\" ends on a lengthy, unnerving fever-dream interview with the ghost of 2Pac. The music, meanwhile, follows a long line of genre-busting freakouts (The Roots’ Phrenology, Common’s Electric Circus, Q-Tip’s Kamaal the Abstract, André 3000’s The Love Below) in kicking at the confines of rap music presentation. There’s half a jazz band present at all times; pianist Robert Glasper, producer/sax player Terrace Martin and bass wizard Thundercat give Butterfly a loose, fluid undertow every bit as tempestuous and unpredictable as the army of flows at Kendrick’s disposal. The rapper’s branching out, too, exploding into spastic slam poetry on \"For Free?\", switching from shouty gymnastics to drunken sobs on \"u\" and even effecting the lilt of a caring mother on \"You Ain’t Gotta Lie (Momma Said)\". It turns out Kendrick’s new direction was every direction at once. Despite all this, he’s still toying with a narrative on the sly: Just beneath the surface lies a messianic yarn about avoiding the wiles of a sultry girl named Lucy who’s secretly a physical manifestation of the devil. Kendrick refuses to dole out blame without accepting any, however, and on the chaotic free jazz excursion \"u\" he turns a mirror on himself, screaming \"Loving you is complicated!\" and suggesting his fame hasn’t helped his loved ones back home. Kendrick’s criticisms, as they did on good kid, come with powerful, self-imposed challenges. As Bilal quips on the chorus to \"Institutionalized\": \"Shit don’t change until you get up and wash your ass, nigga.\" Kendrick’s principle of personal responsibility has treaded dangerously close to respectability politics lately, especially after a prickly remark about the Mike Brown shooting in a recent Billboard interview that seemed to pin the death on the victim, but To Pimp a Butterfly avoids that trap. (Mostly.) \"Complexion (A Zulu Love)\" is a tender note of appreciation for women of all skin tones with help from North Carolina rapper Rapsody (whose slickly referential guest verse contains a nod to \"Good and Bad Hair\"). This is an album about tiny quality of life improvements to be made in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. It might not be the message we want in a year where systemic police and judicial inequality have cost many the ultimate price, but that doesn’t bankrupt it of value. To Pimp a Butterfly pivots on the polarizing lead single, \"i\". Upon release last autumn, the sunny soul pep talk came off lightweight and glib. When it appears deep in the back end of Butterfly, though, \"i\" plays less like the jingle we heard last year and more like the beating heart of the matter. To push the point, the album opts for a live-sounding mix that ditches out midway through, giving way to a speech from the rapper himself. In tone, the speech is not unlike the legendary 1968 concert where James Brown waved off security and personally held off a Boston audience’s fury after news broke that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated. \"How many niggas we done lost, bro?\" Kendrick shouts over the crowd. \"It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left.\" Underneath the tragedy and adversity, To Pimp a Butterfly is a celebration of the audacity to wake up each morning to try to be better, knowing it could all end in a second, for no reason at all.",["http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/21657/homepage_large.d47a5880.jpg"]]

Billed as a soundtrack to coincide with the new N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton, the album finds him sounding charged-up, relevant, and coming to terms with his career for himself, not others. Find it at:Amoeba Music Dr. Dre has been holed away for a worrying amount of time. A few years ago, he released a pair of singles ostensibly linked to his since-abandoned third album, Detox, and they were dire. \"I Need a Doctor\", in particular, was awkward and clunky, and it seemed as though Dre was straining too hard to perfect his comeback. He only re-emerged from the shadows in the name of Aftermath's latter-day luminary, Kendrick Lamar, who appeared to be energizing the elder statesman. But even Dre's surprise appearance on Lamar's major label debut good kid, m.A.A.d city in 2012 felt disjointed, providing more reason to fret over the producer's impending solo return. News that Dre had scrapped Detox entirely was confirmed alongside the announcement of this new album. Years of build-up washed away in the cancellation. It must have been a unique catharsis, purging an undeliverable hype with something tangible finally in hand. Compton isn't a bait-and-switch. If anything, the album is undersold by its billing as a soundtrack, a tag that misleads how well it stands on its own originality. Dre claims the recording was inspired by the set of Straight Outta Compton, the just-released biopic about N.W.A., and for a guy who's been helplessly coddling music in private for years, Compton ended up being a bit of a rush job. And yet, that haste helps the album sound more of-the-moment and free-flowing. For the first time in more than a decade, Dre's inspiration met up with a corporate deadline, and you can see the appeal for him: an opportunity to bundle his final record with a blockbuster movie about his career's origins. In that way, he's toying with the bookends of his career, polishing the story of his come-up while coming to terms with how to step away for good. Dre has been here before, of course, years removed from a game-changer with an entire industry's eyes trained on him, wondering, \"How might he do it again?\" But he's less invested in building a comeback narrative on Compton than he was on 2001. Instead, the album finds Dre coming to terms with his career for himself, not others. If there's a surprise here, it's that Dre, a 50-year-old near-billionaire long suspected of drifting out of touch, sounds charged-up, nimble, and relevant. Dre has always relied on other rappers and producers for inspiration and his own legacy is tied up in showcasing talent, lifting and rearranging it for his own cause. On Compton he's taken the approach and doubled down, and while the album is frequently personal, it's also communal, pushing his own voice towards the margins in favor of other vocalists. The first raps we hear on the album are delivered by King Mez, a Raleigh native who, alongside Justus, the least known of the album's features, appears to have helped Dre with the bulk of his lyric writing. (Either one or both of them are credited on all but one of Dre's vocal tracks.) When Dre comes in on verse two of the sweeping opener \"Talk About It\", he brags about his unopened Eminem royalty checks and jokes about buying the state of California. It's a reminder that Dre is the richest hip-hop artist ever, but he actually seems more interested in pinning down and framing his influence than bragging about his bank account. \"Genocide\" is the earliest and clearest standout, carrying one of two showstopping Kendrick Lamar appearances, who bends and stretches his voice to the limits he encountered on To Pimp a Butterfly. The song is also the first instance on the album of Dre sounding completely unlike himself. To be sure, he's always been an obvious conduit as a rapper, unashamedly channeling the flow and cadence of his ghostwriters, but here he's adopted a delivery that spills out in bursts, his register is higher, and he's snarling; it's not the only place on Compton that Dre's rapping is both impressively light-footed and almost unrecognizable. Musically, the album is a reminder that Dre's palette and appetite for sound has always been eclectic, and rather than retread, we hear him pushing into new territory. At one moment, he's sampling an obscure modern funk band from Italy (for \"One Shot One Kill\") and the next, lifting a guitar riff from a random Turkish psychedelic burner. Throughout, session musicians polish out the edges, and Dre continues to lean on live keys and bass to fill out chunky bottom ends. Dre's quietest and most stalwart collaborator behind the boards on Compton is Focus…, son of Chic bassist Bernard Edwards and a longtime Aftermath in-house guy. (Focus… ditched the label in 2009 after spending years on end piling music into the Detox dump. He returned a few years later, working directly alongside Dre.) If Focus… is the easily overlooked workhorse—he contributes keys and bass as well as frequent co-production credits—higher-profile appearances from the likes of DJ Premier and DJ Dahi inflect Dre's music with their personalities. Primo's offering comes in the form of \"Animals\", impressively billed as the first-ever Premier and Dre collaboration. (Russian producer BMB SpaceKid programmed drums, which carry the best of the Gang Starr producer's fingerprints.) The song is also the most politically pressing on the album and nearly 30 years after \"Fuck Tha Police\" we hear desperation in place of rage. Anderson .Paak, a young multi-talent from Los Angeles who's all over Compton, finds his star turn here. (The song originally belonged to him and Premier.) Still, Dre's verse is powerful, a member of the one percent grappling with racism and the depressingly consistent anguish of being Black in America. \"Why the fuck are they after me?\" he booms, \"Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard, or maybe 'cause of the way my hair grow naturally.\" The cast of musicians employed on Compton is as varied as ever, but some of the most dramatic displays come from the legends. On \"One Shot One Kill\" Snoop Dogg rekindles an agitated menace that he seemed to have lost more than a decade ago. Xzibit and Cold 187um dip into a perfect stride over the meandering \"Loose Cannons\". The Game, for the first time since The Documentary, sounds like he deserved that original Dre co-sign, owning his original identity instead of falling into chameleonic flow-stealing. \"Deep Water\" is the most dynamic and brooding cut, a moment where everyone's contributions click into place. Anderson .Paak's performance as a drowning man is upsetting and uncomfortable, while Kendrick Lamar appears to be throwing Drake subliminals—and enlisting Dre in doing so. His verse is so overspilling with genius technicality that it's hard to dwell in any one place. Part of the trouble in anticipating a new Dre album, then, has been a difficulty in framing our expectations. Hip-hop has been evolving around Dr. Dre for decades: He injected the type of ambitious orchestration into the genre that helped it modernize in the '90s, cannibalizing and assimilating everything around it. On his previous classics he showed us that new things were possible, a magic that's available only so many times in one life. Compton doesn't have the same breathtaking power, but it's excellent nonetheless, and more complicated and jarring than we could have known to hope for. The biggest and most immediately recognizable accomplishments here are basic: Dre is doing more than just fitting in or harking back, and both of those inclinations together were the real nail biters surrounding his new music anyway. Knowing that this is Dre's finale, there's a pleasant melancholy that frames Compton, and with the music in our ears, acknowledging that maybe that's for the best.",["http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/22197/homepage_large.8ef1a836.jpg"]]

His Wraptaypes series, which is anthologized here, is a good place to get a feel for his aesthetic: Basically, he strips original works of their elements, samples the remains he deems useful, and engraves them with his signature. Find it at:Amoeba Music Featured Tracks: \"Ignorntsht\" — KnxwledgeVia  Bandcamp / Buy \"Strtdfrmthebttm\" — KnxwledgeVia  Bandcamp / Buy Despite having a Bandcamp page as thick as a double-stuffed booklet of CDs, Knxwledge's semi-breakthrough didn't arrive until he contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly last year. \"Momma,\" equal parts slow-burning soul and dazed funk, is emblematic of the producer's style: You can hear conspicuous traces of Madlib and J Dilla, but an individual sound emanates through their influence. Knxwledge's ongoing Wraptaypes series is a good place to get a feel for his aesthetic: On these mixes, he layers a mixture of vocals and audio clips laid atop his production—vintage beat tapes with voices for added emphasis. The Wraptaypes anthology compiles 26 such productions created between 2011 and 2015 into a highlight reel. His sample selections are noteworthy, but his repurposing of them is the resonant accomplishment. Wraptaypes involves Knxwledge stripping original works of their elements, taking the remains he deemed useful and engraving them with his signature. It's an aggressive, dissociative process, in which he basically decapitates source material like action figures and sews the heads onto music he's composed. The face (or, rather, the voice) is the same, but the limbs, extremities, and heart are all different. As a result, the ensemble of bit players Knxwledge weaves into each web becomes part of something original. Knxwledge allows each track—no matter how short or unpolished it is—to stand as its own entity. In each instance, the outcome is rewardingly distinct. \"Strtdfrmthebttm\" slows Drake's \"humble\" recollections, trading urgency for a warm, mellow haze for the better part of two minutes. (Kudos to Knxwledge for reimagining a club anthem as a lush, scenic Urban Outfitters composition—that's a feat.) An Eazy-E verse from \"Tha Muthaphukkin Real\" contrasts the lazy strings and 808s on \"Iwish\" before Carl Thomas' voice literally chirps in, accelerated to Alvin and the Chipmunks speeds, Heatmakerz style. Inebriated keys turn Sheek Louch and Jadakiss into charming lounge singers on \"Choosewun\"; the first portion of \"Choppas\" does the same to Lil Wayne. The anthology also showcases Knxwledge's perceptive grasp of how certain instruments drive songs, namely the unrestrained '80s sitcom sax on \"21kwestions\" and Ernie Isley's screaming guitar on \"Allwegot.\" Details count, so artifacts like different parts of the same Boyz n the Hood scene used at the beginning of \"Ignorntsht\" and end of \"Gotstaprove\" are welcome pop culture Easter Eggs for the film enthusiasts. Anthologies have no hidden messages or intricate narrative structures; they're collections meant to be taken at face value. Wraptaypes, however, is as much a snapshot of Knxwledge's mind as it is an aggregate of music.

Featuring Kanye West, Young Thug, and Drake.  Find it at:Amoeba Music Featured Tracks: \"Back on Road\" [ft. Drake] — Gucci ManeVia SoundCloud After a Twitter “meltdown” for the books, Gucci Mane violated probation and went to jail in 2013 persona non grata. In May, he emerged as if from a chrysalis, healthy, clean, and sober. He was greeted with acclaim that, while not as intense as his fever-hot peak in 2009, suggested a much broader cultural consensus about his music. One hopes it’s because the world finally caught up with the creative breadth of his work, but more likely it’s because they’ve recognized that work's consequences. Following his late-’00s mixtape supernova, Gucci Mane became a vector, both creative and collaborative, for a new generation of hip-hop stars: Migos, Chief Keef,  and Young Thug, to name a few. In the three years he was away, this influence narrative became conventional wisdom, and a shortcut to argue his significance; those who doubted his creative capabilities couldn’t deny his impact. The title of the first project since his release, Everybody Looking, could as easily describe this influence as it does his status as a trending topic. (It’s also a reference to his 2010 track of the same name, which would be the best song on this compilation by some miles were it included.) For several years, everybody—at least in the realm of underground street rap—really was looking to Gucci for where to go next. For the most part, Everybody Looking is a Gucci Mane mixtape in the most familiar sense. It will please fans looking for Another Gucci Mane mixtape. Everyone else will likely find it a bit spotty. Certain songs fall into familiar—now six- or seven-year-old—formulas. His vocals, no doubt out of practice, sound a bit rusty. But most of all, it just feels unfinished, rushed—halfway between a tribute to the improvisational tapes of his classic era and a fully-rendered album statement, it’s best considered a stopgap to tide over fans. A few records on Everybody Looking stand apart, suggesting the seeds of a better, unrealized project. While Zaytoven’s “Out Do Ya” feels like a by-numbers 2009 pastiche, his turn on “Waybach” sounds fresh. The gritty Mike WiLL-produced “Pop Music” is a dark double-entendre that recalls the clever urgency of Gucci’s earlier work without falling into caricature. “Gucci Please” features hypnotic songwriting and a flow pattern that’s yet to suffer from overexposure. And bonus track “Multi Millionaire Laflare” is the moment his rapping sounds its most inspired: “Wrist so rocky got your bitch jockin' ASAP/Every nigga tote a yopper, nigga we a K-Camp.” None of these records push too far into new terrain, but they do make the case that there’s gas in the tank. The space between those moments find Gucci sliding into a frozen approximation of earlier formulas. His lyrics can lean boilerplate. This is blatant on “Richest N**** In the Room,” where he peddles a familiar  autobiographical tale he’s been spinning since the beginning. It’s a long-running songwriting archetype for him, but one with which we’re familiar at this point; without new details or a fresh approach, it’s more like hitting the requisite checkboxes than creating. The most unique and interesting aspects of Gucci’s life right now involve his three-year sentence, new healthy lifestyle, and flowering lovelife; they are occasionally alluded to throughout, but for the most part this project is unified by frequent references to his looming influence. While interesting to consider—in a wonkish sense—this is less than fascinating as the subject of music. It’s also become, just in the past year, less true; single “All My Children,” a reference to his aesthetic offspring, might have better been titled “All My Grandchildren,” as the new generation shows a closer debt to Guwop's spiritual heir Chief Keef. If albums are carefully selected, heavily A&Red projects designed to maximize an artist’s potential and impact, mixtapes have been a method for under-funded artists to perform a flanking maneuver. Notionally, a mixtape is different than an album in that it’s faster to put together, and perhaps a bit less consequential song-for-song, its best ideas spread out over multiple releases. Yet at his recorded peak in the late 2000s, Gucci gained such creative momentum he drowned out carefully-crafted releases by seemingly “bigger” artists. Everybody Looking is a tribute to that era. But it’s not that era, and Gucci is no longer that artist. Though his music typically transcended the “disposable” mixtape medium in the late ’00s, those tapes were strategic efforts at pushing to a higher level. Once he got there, partially thanks to his label but perhaps also of his own design (he’d expressed the desire to work with Timbaland and the Neptunes in interviews), the A&R system threw him onto generic pop-rap records, underestimating his songwriting significance, seeing him—as many have before and since—as a wacky character simply in need of pricier framing.  This one-dimensional view of him as a charismatic character, rather than a craft-driven artist with his talons plunged deep into the fabric of American music, meant that recognition of his formal innovations was delayed. This artist was telling us where American music was going, and we tried to force him to follow us instead. Rather than working on records which emphasized and refined his own ideas, we ended up with “Spotlight” and “Gucci Time.” Who does everybody look to when their idol looks to others? An ideal future Gucci album, then, forgets about his “influence” as an end goal in itself. “Influence,” after all, is merely a side-effect of vision, originality and creativity. Moments here—as on recent guest verses for Dreezy and Kodak Black—suggest he’s still got it. Rather than chasing some past mixtape “golden era,” here’s hoping he faces the new challenge of making an album that celebrates him for being him.",["http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/23530/homepage_large.3c63aa97.jpg"]]
