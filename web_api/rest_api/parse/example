Written by an Czech,looks like, and even uses absolutely the same language to describe Germans as Soviet conspiracy authors used to describe the evil American imperialist spies somewhat later! Gestapo agents roaming Holland with passports valid for 14 days that are somehow supposed to prevent them from defecting are a real gem!!! Reviewer: notmtwain - - April 26, 2006 Subject: Nazi Use of Fifth Column Technique in Pre-war Europe Writing in 1939, the author reviews the period 1937 to 1939 when the Nazis were able to obtain all of their desires for expansion (Austria, Czechoslovakia, the Ruhr, etc.) without having to fight. They used negotiation, intimidation and their foreign agents to influence foreign policy in Britain and other major foreign powers. They also used the influence of the wealthy, whose fear of communism led them to favor the development of fascist countries. The author warns about similar techniques being used within the United States-- to keep us out of the war and to weaken us in the event of war. To me, the story was enlightening and plausible. Most other histories I've seen of this period gloss over the details, so I enjoyed reading it. It is one man's view of the coming debacle and must have been enlightening to some people during the period before America entered the war.

This is the largest web crawl attempted by Internet Archive. The project was designed to take a global snapshot of the Web. Please browse through the resulting collection. Special thanks to the memory institutions who contributed URLs to the crawl. The crawl began with 18,000 websites from over 60 countries. Web Archiving Services Archive-It allows institutions to build and preserve their own web archive of born digital content, through a user friendly web application, without requiring any technical expertise or hosting facilities. Subscribers can harvest, catalog, and archive their collections, and then search and browse the collections when complete. Collections are hosted at the Internet Archive data center, and accessible to the public with full text search. With the rapid growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web, millions of people have grown accustomed to using these tools as resources to acquire information; and the availability of electronic information is taken for granted. However, it is a fallacy that if something is on the web, it will be there forever. The average lifespan of a web page is 44 -75 days. There's an urgent need for people to understand that that web is who we are. It's our culture and our social fabric, and we don't want to lose any of it. What is here today might be gone tomorrow. Archive-It is designed to fit the needs of many types of organizations and individuals. The over 50 partners include: state archives, university libraries, federal institutions, state libraries, non government non profits, museums, historians, and independent researchers. Contact the Archive-It team for more details about subscribing to this service and to learn more about our Curated and Domain Crawl services. Contract Crawls are for large topic, event or domain collections run by Internet Archive crawl engineers at an institutions' request.

In contrast, the Live Music Archive forum is a more general venue for discussion about thousands of other LMA bands, and for more general technical questions about the LMA collection.

That a new medium of distribution has arisen - digital audio files being traded over the Internet - does not change our policy in this regard. Our stipulations regarding digital distribution are merely extensions of those long-standing principles and they are as follow: No commercial gain may be sought by websites offering digital files of our music, whether through advertising, exploiting databases compiled from their traffic, or any other means. All participants in such digital exchange acknowledge and respect the copyrights of the performers, writers and publishers of the music. This notice should be clearly posted on all sites engaged in this activity. We reserve the ability to withdraw our sanction of non-commercial digital music should circumstances arise that compromise our ability to protect and steward the integrity of our work.

Read by Alan Chant. Two boys from the Foundling Hospital are given the same name, with disastrous consequences in adulthood. Two associates, wishing to right the wrong, are commissioned to find a missing heir. Their quest takes them from fungous wine cellars in the City of London to the sunshine of the Mediterranean â across the Alps in winter. Danger and treachery would prevail were it not for the courage of the heroine and the faithful company servant. The story contains crafted descriptions, well-drawn and diverse characters, eerie and exotic backgrounds, mystery, semi-concealed identities, brinkmanship with death, romance, the eventual triumph of Good over Evil, and many other elements expected in classic Dickens. First published in 1867 there are thematic parallels with other books from Dickens' mature writings, including Little Dorrit (1857) and especially Our Mutual Friend (1865). The Listener will decide if this story yields insights into The Mystery of Edwin Drood (unfinished 1870). Wilkie Collings collaborated with Charles Dickens to produce this âChristmasâ book and the stage play of the same name. In the book Collins assisted in Act 1 and Act 4; Collins scripted most of the stage play with Dickensâ assistance. If this book were released today it would be splashed \"THE BOOK OF THE FILM\".

Reviewer: Bosslady93 - - April 23, 2008 Subject: Great Read Mr. Alan Chant, I would like to thank you for making my work day go by so fast. I really enjoyed your reading of this classic story. Reviewer: Philippe Horak - - April 7, 2008 Subject: A lovely recording Two boys from the Foundling Hospital are given the same name, with disastrous consequences in adulthood. After the death of one – now a proprietor of a wine merchant’s company - the executors, to right the wrong, are commissioned to find a missing heir. Their quest takes them from fungous wine cellars in the City of London to the sunshine of the Mediterranean—across the Alps in winter.

All that while giving a nod to Robert A. Heinlein's classic SciFi-novel of the same title. On side B \"Depth Charge\" lifts off full force with deep echo madness, wide explosions in 3D, basslines coming straight from a Black Hole and crunchy 8bit-Gamma-rays from beyond the dibbi dibbi rings of Saturn!

[George Samuel Newth was brother to Kate NEWTH born c1846 Shropshire, Brother to Anne Elizabeth NEWTH born Mar 1844, registered Madeley Shropshire (Who married Samuel Edward BUTTENSHAW (1871) a secretary Islington), Brother to James Aldridge NEWTH Born Jun 1847 Plymouth, Devon - died 10 Aug 1923 Lane Cove Sydney buried Waverley cemetery, Australia.(Palmeston settler, Manawatu.) This book (one of 5 books by G S Newth published by Longman, Green & Company of London, England) first appeared in 1892 and is a fascinating collection of chemistry lecture experiments all of which the author had tried for himself. This book is hard to find now outside of libraries.A couple of books on chemical lecture experiments were subsequently published by other authors using Newth's format. A book with the same title by American chemist Frederick G Benedict (1870-1957), [who was to become well known himself in later years] was first published in 1901 and acknowledges Newths book (2nd edition printed in 1900) in the preface and in the bibliography. [Note: An interesting 1899 book of chemistry experiments for schools by the American teacher Walter Monroe was able to offer a simplified and safer approach to chemistry experiments - even by more modern standards.] The final reprint of Newth's 'Chemical Lecture Experiments' appeared in the late 1920s. His other books were 'Inorganic Chemistry' (the most popular and remembered) first published in 1894 although the earliest copy I have seen was 1896 and which was revised and reprinted many times (with author updates to 1923), the final version appearing in 1940. Old copies can be found for sale quite reasonably priced from internet book suppliers. It has been reported of John D R Thomas past president (1990) of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 'Analytical Proceedings, July 1990, Vol 27 p161 that his interest in chemistry derived from his father’s 1913 edition of G. S. Newth’s “Elementary Practical Chemistry-A Laboratory Manual for Use in Organized Science Schools,”. Herbert Marcus Powell's (1906-1991) biographical details [Biog.Mems. Fell. R. Soc. Lond. 46, 425-442 (2000)] include a poem he wrote about chemicals (The Chemists Dream) which included the lines - \"I awoke upon a grassy bank beside the river Pharpar In a scene that would have gladdened G.S. Newth or Bruce and Harper\"- Other books Newth had published included 'A Manual of Chemical Analysis - Qualitative and Quantitative' in 1898 and 'Elementary Practical Chemistry' first published about 1896 (earliest UK copy seen is 1904) which was for school chemistry classes. This book was called 'Elementary Inorganic Chemistry' when sold in the USA. 'Smaller Chemical Analysis' published in 1906. was his final book. An American, George D Timmons had a book published in 1912 (Longman Green and Co) called 'Questions on Newth's Inorganic Chemistry' which is hard to find outside of the British Library (BL system number 003640330). Newth also had a number of papers published. For example: \"An apparatus for showing experiments with ozone. GS Newth Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions 69, 1298-1299, Royal Society of Chemistry, 1896. and \"Notes on partially miscible aqueous inorganic liquids\" J. Chem. Soc., Trans., 1900, 77, 775 - 778. Another paper gave an improved method for producing ethylene in the laboratory. Jour. Chem. Soc., 1901, 79, p. 915 George Samuel Newth was also in his youth a keen cyclist and his name appears in a copy of a US cycle magazine 'The Wheelman' under 'Wheel News' on page 234 in 1883 when he was challenged to a race. \"Mr. G. S. Newth, of New College, Hampstead,has accepted Mr.Wilson’s “Faed’s”challenge to riders of the “Otto” for a road race, in order to test the comparative speed of the “Otto” and the tricycle\". His wife was Margaret Newth and there is no record of any children. His name and address details can be had from UK Census records etc. Newth was a demonstrator in Chemistry at The Royal College of Science in London (now Imperial College) from the 1880s up to about 1910. He worked with other noted chemists including Frankland and W A Tilden. Newth's books are well worth buying and are a fascinating insight into late Victorian chemistry for schools and colleges and he was in many ways ahead of his time. George Samuel Newth died in Hythe, Kent, England in 1936. (D.Mullen, Liverpool, England).

["20080430","http://www.archive.org/about/faq.php?faq_id=252","Internet Archive: Frequently Asked Questions   Frequently Asked Questions What are FLAC files and how can I listen to them? FLAC stands for free lossless audio codec. It is an open source, lossless compression algorithm for digital music. It compresses music files to 50-60% of their original size, with no loss in quality. More FLAC information can be found on the FLAC sourceforge site and in this etree FAQ. If you upload FLAC filesets to the LMA, please follow the naming standards to help the checking program here. Directories should be named with .flac16 or .flac24 suffix, not .flac. Otherwise, the program will report failures. To listen to FLAC files: Macintosh: Download and install MacAmp Lite, a multi-format audio player, and then install the FLAC Plugin for MacAmp. Windows: Download and install WinAmp, a multi-format audio player, and then install the FLAC Plugin for WinAmp. If you would like to use FLAC with your Windows Media Player (WMP) download and install the Directshow Filters for Ogg Vorbis, Speex, Theora and FLAC. This will allow WMP to not only play .flac files but .ogg files as well. Linux or any other UNIX-based architecture: Download and copy \"libxmms-flac.so\" to your XMMS media player input plugins folder. See all Frequently Asked Questions  ",[]]

Currently, the Live Music Archive will only accept audio files in either of two lossless formats: FLAC (.flac) or Shorten (.shn). Please Note that MKW files (.mkw) are *NOT* an acceptable file format for your contributions because they lack cross-platform compatibility (Mac users are unable to play or decode MKW files) In addition, please do not upload the lossy files (MP3 or OGG) next to your FLAC or SHN format files - the Archive creates those files automatically, provided that the contributor agrees to having them available. This ensures that all the files here have uniform quality options selected. Please follow etree.org's Seeding Guidelines when preparing your contributions for addition to the collection. Pay particular attention to the Naming Standards section. A well-named identifier helps patrons find your show in our large collection. A well-named set of files allows files to be listed in the proper order at the site, and allows patrons to listen to them in playlists and burn them to CD in the proper order, too.

The best way for us to find out is by getting permission from a band representative or by the band's having an explicit policy that covers this type of site. If there are no shows by the band, either we don't have enough of this information to go forward with archiving, they have declined participation, or we are ready to accept shows but no one has uploaded anything yet.

Sometimes people make typos or other mistakes on uploads, or leave gaps in info that can be filled in later. You can help supply good information for archived items. Here is the current best method to submit corrections: If you uploaded the show, you can make the changes to the details page yourself. Make sure you are logged in as the user who uploaded the show and go to the details page of the show you are trying edit. Click on the \"edit\" link next to the band name at the top of the details page and you will be able to edit the show details including venue, location, source, setlist, etc. Be aware that editing these fields will only change the show details, not the files themselves. 5/2006 update: If you uploaded the item and would like to replace or add to files within your item, under the current system this can be done without reuploading the entire fileset. More description may follow; meanwhile there is a walkthrough as a Word document with screenshots. Specifically to fix your items derived between 5/11-22/2006 that sound too fast in the onsite flash player (chipmunk problem), see this PDF document with screenshots. If you did not upload the show, please click the 'Report Error' button and state concisely and precisely what the problem with that particular show is (If the problem is a missing setlist, please see this FAQ).

Engineers are still working on the best method for the new system. Lossless: A ZIP file containing Shorten files or Flac files. Unlike formats like MP3, lossless formats are true to the original - there is no degradation in quality. Hi-Fi: A ZIP file containing MP3 files encoded with a variable bit rate to deliver high quality at roughly 160kilobits per second. Lo-Fi: A ZIP file containing MP3 files encoded at a constant bit rate of 64 kilobits per second. These files are ideal for users with slower Internet connections. FTP: Using an FTP client you can log in to the Archive's servers and download all of the files at once. Other Web Options: All files are displayed as individual links on any item's details page.

Alexa Internet has been crawling the web since 1996, which has resulted in a massive archive. If you have a web site, and you would like to ensure that it is saved for posterity in the Internet Archive, and you've searched wayback and found no results, you can visit the Alexa's \"Webmasters\" page at http://pages.alexa.com/help/webmasters/index.html#crawl_site. Method 2: if you have the Alexa tool bar installed, just visit a site. Method 3: while visiting a site, use the 'show related links' in Internet Explorer, which uses the Alexa service. In all cases, ensure that your site's 'robots.txt' rules and in-page META robots directives do not tell crawlers to avoid your site. Sites are usually crawled within 8 weeks of submission, sometimes much sooner. However, there is at least a 6 month lag between the date a site is crawled and the date it appears in the Wayback Machine. How can I remove my site's pages from the Wayback Machine? The Internet Archive is not interested in preserving or offering access to Web sites or other Internet documents of persons who do not want their materials in the collection. By placing a simple robots.txt file on your Web server, you can exclude your site from being crawled as well as exclude any historical pages from the Wayback Machine. Internet Archive uses the exclusion policy intended for use by both academic and non-academic digital repositories and archivists. See our exclusion policy. Here are directions on how to automatically exclude your site. If you cannot place the robots.txt file, opt not to, or have further questions, email us at info at archive dot org. What is the Internet Archive Wayback Machine? The Internet Archive Wayback Machine is a service that allows people to visit archived versions of Web sites. Visitors to the Wayback Machine can type in a URL, select a date range, and then begin surfing on an archived version of the Web. Imagine surfing circa 1999 and looking at all the Y2K hype, or revisiting an older version of your favorite Web site. The Internet Archive Wayback Machine can make all of this possible. Can I link to old pages on the Wayback Machine? Yes! The Wayback Machine is built so that it can be used and referenced. If you find an archived page that you would like to reference on your Web page or in an article, you can copy the URL. You can even use fuzzy URL matching and date specification... but that's a bit more advanced. Why isn't the site I'm looking for in the archive? Some sites may not be included because the automated crawlers were unaware of their existence at the time of the crawl. It's also possible that some sites were not archived because they were password protected, blocked by robots.txt, or otherwise inaccessible to our automated systems. Siteowners might have also requested that their sites be excluded from the Wayback Machine. When this has occurred, you will see a \"blocked site error\" message. When a site is excluded because of robots.txt you will see a \"robots.txt query exclusion error\" message. What does it mean when a site's archive data has been \"updated\"? When our automated systems crawl the web every few months or so, we find that only about 50% of all pages on the web have changed from our previous visit. This means that much of the content in our archive is duplicate material. If you don't see \"\"*\"\" next to an archived document, then the content on the archived page is identical to the previously archived copy. Who was involved in the creation of the Internet Archive Wayback Machine? \"The original idea for the Internet Archive Wayback Machine began in 1996, when the Internet Archive first began archiving the web. Now, five years later, with over 100 terabytes and a dozen web crawls completed, the Internet Archive has made the Internet Archive Wayback Machine available to the public. The Internet Archive has relied on donations of web crawls, technology, and expertise from Alexa Internet and others. The Internet Archive Wayback Machine is owned and operated by the Internet Archive.\" How was the Wayback Machine made? Alexa Internet, in cooperation with the Internet Archive, has designed a three dimensional index that allows browsing of web documents over multiple time periods, and turned this unique feature into the Wayback Machine. How large is the Wayback Machine? The Internet Archive Wayback Machine contains almost 2 petabytes of data and is currently growing at a rate of 20 terabytes per month. This eclipses the amount of text contained in the world's largest libraries, including the Library of Congress. What type of machinery is used in this Internet Archive? Much of the Internet Archive is stored on hundreds of slightly modified x86 servers. The computers run on the Linux operating system. Each computer has 512Mb of memory and can hold just over 1 Terabyte of data on ATA disks. However we are developing a new way of storing our data on a smaller machine. Each machine will store 1 terabyte. For more information go to www.petabox.org. How do you archive dynamic pages? There are many different kinds of dynamic pages, some of which are easily stored in an archive and some of which fall apart completely. When a dynamic page renders standard html, the archive works beautifully. When a dynamic page contains forms, JavaScript, or other elements that require interaction with the originating host, the archive will not contain the original site's functionality. Why are some sites harder to archive than others? If you look at our collection of archived sites, you will find some broken pages, missing graphics, and some sites that aren't archived at all. Here are some things that make it difficult to archive a web site: Robots.txt -- We respect robot exclusion headers. Javascript -- Javascript elements are often hard to archive, but especially if they generate links without having the full name in the page. Plus, if javascript needs to contact the originating server in order to work, it will fail when archived. Server side image maps -- Like any functionality on the web, if it needs to contact the originating server in order to work, it will fail when archived. Unknown sites -- The archive contains crawls of the Web completed by Alexa Internet. If Alexa doesn't know about your site, it won't be archived. Use the Alexa Toolbar (available at www.alexa.com), and it will know about your page. Or you can visit Alexa's Archive Your Site page at http://pages.alexa.com/help/webmasters/index.html#crawl_site. Orphan pages -- If there are no links to your pages, the robot won't find it (the robots don't enter queries in search boxes.) As a general rule of thumb, simple html is the easiest to archive. Some sites are not available because of robots.txt or other exclusions. What does that mean? The Standard for Robot Exclusion (SRE) is a means by which web site owners can instruct automated systems not to crawl their sites. Web site owners can specify files or directories that are disallowed from a crawl, and they can even create specific rules for different automated crawlers. All of this information is contained in a file called robots.txt. While robots.txt has been adopted as the universal standard for robot exclusion, compliance with robots.txt is strictly voluntary. In fact most web sites do not have a robots.txt file, and many web crawlers are not programmed to obey the instructions anyway. However, Alexa Internet, the company that crawls the web for the Internet Archive, does respect robots.txt instructions, and even does so retroactively. If a web site owner decides he / she prefers not to have a web crawler visiting his / her files and sets up robots.txt on the site, the Alexa crawlers will stop visiting those files and will make unavailable all files previously gathered from that site. This means that sometimes, while using the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, you may find a site that is unavailable due to robots.txt (you will see a \"robots.txt query exclusion error\" message). Sometimes a web site owner will contact us directly and ask us to stop crawling or archiving a site, and we endevor to comply with these requests. When you come accross a \"blocked site error\" message, that means that a siteowner has made such a request and it has been honored. How can I help the Internet Archive and the Wayback Machine? The Internet Archive actively seeks donations of digital materials for preservation. If you have digital materials that may be of interest to future generations, please let us know by sending an email to info at archive dot org. The Internet Archive is also seeking additional funding to continue this important mission. You can click the donate tab above or click here. Thank you for considering us in your charitable giving. Can I search the Archive? Using the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, it is possible to search for the names of sites contained in the Archive (URLs) and to specify date ranges for your search. We hope to implement a full text search engine at some point in the future. Why am I getting broken or gray images on a site? Broken images (when there is a small red \"x\" where the image should be) occur when the images are not available on our servers. Usually this means that we did not archive them. Gray images are the result of robots.txt exclusions. The site in question may have blocked robot access to their images directory. How do I contact the Internet Archive? All questions about the Wayback Machine, or other Internet Archive projects, should be addressed to info at archive dot org. What is the Wayback Machine's Copyright Policy? The Internet Archive respects the intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights of others. The Internet Archive may, in appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, remove certain content or disable access to content that appears to infringe the copyright or other intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your copyright has been violated by material available through the Internet Archive, please provide the Internet Archive Copyright Agent with the following information: Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; An exact description of where the material about which you complain is located within the Internet Archive collections; Your address, telephone number, and email address; A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the owner of the copyright interest involved or are authorized to act on behalf of that owner; Your electronic or physical signature.

Box 29244 San Francisco, CA 94129 Phone: 415-561-6767 Email: info at archive dot org Why is the Internet Archive collecting sites from the Internet? What makes the information useful? Most societies place importance on preserving artifacts of their culture and heritage. Without such artifacts, civilization has no memory and no mechanism to learn from its successes and failures. Our culture now produces more and more artifacts in digital form. The Archive's mission is to help preserve those artifacts and create an Internet library for researchers, historians, and scholars. The Archive collaborates with institutions including the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian. Do you archive email? Chat? No, we do not collect or archive chat systems or personal email messages that have not been posted to Usenet bulletin boards or publicly accessible online message boards. Do you collect all the sites on the Web? No, we collect only publicly accessible Web pages. We do not archive pages that require a password to access, pages tagged for \"robot exclusion\" by their owners, pages that are only accessible when a person types into and sends a form, or pages on secure servers. If a site owner properly requests removal of a Web site through http://www.archive.org/about/exclude.php, we will exclude that site from the Wayback Machine. Is there any personal information in these collections? We collect Web pages that are publicly accessible. These may include pages with personal information. Who has access to the collections? What about the public? Anyone can access our collections through our website archive.org. The web archive can be searched using the Wayback Machine. The Archive makes the collections available at no cost to researchers, historians, and scholars. At present, it takes someone with a certain level of technical knowledge to access collections in a way other than our website, but there is no requirement that a user be affiliated with any particular organization. How can I get a copy of the pages on my Web site? If my site got hacked or damaged, could I get a backup from the Archive?' Our terms of use do not cover backups for the general public. However, you may use the Internet Archive Wayback Machine to locate and access archived versions of your web site. We can't guarantee that your site has been or will be archived. For siteowners only we offer limited backup capabilites. Send your request to info at archive dot org for more information. Can people download sites from the Wayback? Our terms of use specify that users of the Wayback Machine are not to copy data from the collection. If there are special circumstances that you think the Archive should consider, please contact info at archive dot org. How do you protect my privacy if you archive my site? The Archive collects Web pages that are publicly available â the same ones that you might find as you surfed around the Web. We do not archive pages that require a password to access, pages tagged for \"robot exclusion\" by their owners, pages that are only accessible when a person types into and sends a form, or pages on secure servers. We also provide information on removing a site from the collections. Those who use the collections must agree to certain terms of use. Like a public library, the Archive provides free and open access to its collections to researchers, historians, and scholars. Our cultural norms have long promoted access to documents that were, but no longer are, publicly accessible. Given the rate at which the Internet is changing â the average life of a Web page is only 77 days â if no effort is made to preserve it, it will be entirely and irretrievably lost. Rather than let this moment slip by, we are proceeding with documenting the growth and content of the Internet, using libraries as our model. If you are interested in these issues, please join and contribute to our announcement and discussion lists. What does 'failed connection' and other error messages mean? Below is a list of the main error messages you will see while searching the Wayback Machine. If you see an error message that does not have the Internet Archive Wayback Machine logo in the upper left corner, you are most likely looking at an archived page or the live web. Failed Connection: The server that the particular piece of information lives on is down. Generally these clear up within two weeks. Robots.txt Query Exclusion: A robots.txt is something that a site owner puts on their site that keeps crawlers like our own from crawling them. The Internet Archive retroactively respects all robots.txt. Blocked Site Error: Site owners, copyright holders and others who fit Internet Archive's exclusion policy have requested that the site be excluded from the Wayback Machine. For exclusion criteria, please see our exclusion policy (we use the same one used and developed by other digital repositories and archivists both academic and non-academic). Path Index Error: A path index error message refers to a problem in our database wherein the information requested is not available (generally because of a machine or software issue, however each case can be different). We cannot always completely fix these errors in a timely manner. Not in Archive: Generally this means that the site archived has a redirect on it and the site you are redirected to is not in the archive or cannot be found on the live web. Why are there no recent archives in the Wayback Machine? It generally takes 6 months or more for pages to appear in the Wayback Machine after they are collected, because of delays in transferring material to long-term storage and indexing. There is no access to files before they appear in the Wayback Machine. How does the Wayback Machine behave with Javascript turned off? If you have Javascript turned off, images and links will be from the live web, not from our archive of old Web files. How did I end up on the live version of a site? or I clicked on X date, but now I am on Y date, how is that possible? Not every date for every site archived is 100% complete. When you are surfing an incomplete archived site the Wayback Machine will grab the closest available date to the one you are in for the links that are missing. In the event that we do not have the link archived at all, the Wayback Machine will look for the link on the live web and grab it if available. Pay attention to the date code embedded in the archived url. This is the list of numbers in the middle; it translates as yyyymmddhhmmss. For example in this url http://web.archive.org/web/20000229123340/http://www.yahoo.com/ the date the site was crawled was Feb 29, 2000 at 12:33 and 40 seconds. Where does the name come from? The Wayback Machine is named in reference to the famous Mr. Peabody's WABAC (pronounced way-back) machine from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon show. How do I cite Wayback Machine urls in MLA format? This question is a newer one. We asked MLA to help us with how to cite an archived URL in correct format. They did say that there is no established format for resources like the Wayback Machine, but it's best to err on the side of more information. You should cite the webpage as you would normally, and then give the Wayback Machine information. They provided the following example: McDonald, R. C. \"Basic Canary Care.\" _Robirda Online_. 12 Sept. 2004. 18 Dec. 2006 . _Internet Archive_. < http://web.archive.org/web/20041009202820/http://www.robirda.com/cancare.html>. They added that if the date that the information was updated is missing, one can use the closest date in the Wayback Machine. Then comes the date when the page is retrieved and the original URL. Neither URL should be underlined in the bibliography itself. Thanks MLA! Questions How can I add a thumbnail image to my item's details page? How can I get iTunes to create a new playlist when I stream MP3s? How can I play OGG files on a Mac? I'm having trouble with a 'blank'/corrupted ZIP file. What do I do? How can I add a logo to the upper right corner of my Netlabels collection? How can I get my tracks to show up in the right order? What kind of audio file should I submit? The flash player is covering my files! How do I move it? Audio How can I add a thumbnail image to my item's details page? First, make sure you're logged on to archive.org with the same email address you used to upload the item. The image you upload must be named identifier.jpg (where identifier is your item's identifier name) and you must choose file format JPEG in the metadata editor. To upload the image: Go to your item's details page Click the \"Edit item\" link in the lower left box Click the Item Manager button Click the \"Check out files\" button Upload the image file to the item's directory using FTP Check the item back in After a few minutes, return to your item's details page. Click \"Edit item\" and find the .jpg file you just uploaded in the list of files near the bottom of this page. Select the file format JPEG from the drop down menu, and click the submit button. Wait 5-20 minutes for your changes to show up. If you're still not seeing your new file, please try clearing your cache and viewing the page again, since you may still be looking at an old version of the page. How can I get iTunes to create a new playlist when I stream MP3s? As an iTunes user, you might have noticed that iTunes loads the Archive's streaming MP3s (M3U files) into your library, and subsequentially the files get shuffled and are out of order. We have come up with a solution to this problem. Step by step instructions: Download this AppleScript application. Copy the m3uPlayer application to a permanent location Choose some recording in the Archive to stream. This will cause an M3U to download to your default download folder (typically your desktop). Click on the downloaded M3U file, hit option-I (or option-click and select Get Info). Change \"open with\" from ITunes to m3uPlayer (locate it wherever you saved it) Click change all so that all future M3U files will open this way That's it! If you have trouble, post a message to this forum Thanks to http://www.balnaves.com/archives/000092.php for the code, instructions, and inspiration How can I play OGG files on a Mac? On the mac, there is a free component to ogg-ify itunes. The freeware VLC Media Player will also play OGG files. http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20020424233612407 I'm having trouble with a 'blank'/corrupted ZIP file. What do I do? There are a variety of problems that may be causing this. Here are a couple of the most common. If you have a Mac running OS X, the default unzip utility (Stuffit) does not deal well with those Archive ZIP files that are 'compressed on the fly'. You may see an empty directory - if so, then try downloading Zip Tools for Mac OS X and using the drag and drop software within that to unzip your download. [Make sure you save your download to your desktop before trying things on it.] If you're having any trouble with downloads timing out or being incomplete, especially on Windows, then you may be able to use download managers such as GetRight. These will restart your download if it fails. However, some 'ZIP on the fly' downloads don't play well with download managers. If you find that to be the case, the safest thing to do is to download each track individually in a download manager, or use FTP to log in. How can I add a logo to the upper right corner of my Netlabels collection? First, make sure you're logged on to archive.org with the same email address you used when you created your Netlabels collection. Then: Go to your collection's front page Click the \"edit\" link next to the title Click Item Manager Check out the item's files Upload the logo to the item's directory using FTP Check the item back in Return to collection front page and click \"edit\" link again Find logo file at bottom of page, choose \"Collection Header\" from the drop down list and click submit. It will take a few minutes for the changes to appear. How can I get my tracks to show up in the right order? The most reliable way to have your tracks appear on the page in the correct order is to name the individual files with track numbers, like this: 01_nameoffirstsong.mp3 02_nameofsecondsong.mp3 03_nameofthirdsong.mp3 (If you have more than 9 files you need to start numbering with 01 - not 1 - otherwise the files will go in this order: 1, 10, 11, 12, 2, 3 etc.) If you have already created an item and you would like to change the file names to rearrange them correctly, do the following: Follow the directions in this FAQ to check out your item and connect via FTP Rename your original files using track numbers Delete all \"derived\" files, leaving only your original files and the .xml files Check the item back in Click \"Edit item\" > \"Item Manager\" and then click the \"derive\" button It will take a little while for the derive to finish running, but once it does you'll have all new files, in the correct order, in both the flash player and the page itself. What kind of audio file should I submit? The archive is all about free access to information, so you should submit file formats that are easily downloadable and/or streamable for other site patrons. We prefer that you submit the highest quality file that you have available, and then we will attempt to create smaller file sizes and formats automatically with our deriver program. We recommend that you do not attempt to do any special encoding of your files - the more settings you mess around with, the less likely our deriver code will be able to process the file. If you are submitting a Live Music Archive item, please only submit Flac or Shorten files. Even for non-LMA items, these are the best formats to use. Whatever format you choose, please upload each file to your item individually (you can submit multiple files per item), in a non-compressed format. Uploading content in a .zip or .rar file makes your item unstreamable and significantly less accessible to others. If you upload .zip, .rar, non-audio formats (like .exe), or password-protected files, they may be removed by our moderators. The table below describes what file formats we will attempt to derive depending on what type of file you submit. The flash player is covering my files! How do I move it? If an item has little or no description, sometimes the flash player doesn't have enough room in the top portion of the page and covers the files below. If you don't want to add a description (which would be nice, so that people know what they're listening to), you can add extra space in the description field using paragraph tags. Click the \"Edit item\" link in the lower left box Add several paragraph tags to the description field, like this: <p> <p> <p> <p> Click the submit button After 10-20 minutes, when you return to your item you should see that the files have moved down further on the page, allowing the flash player enough room at the top. Usually 4-5 <p> tags is enough. Questions How do I view the DJVU books? What is the status of the Internet Bookmobile? How do I view the PDF books? How do I download a book in tk3 format? What equipment does the Bookmobile use to print and bind books? What is the directory structure for the texts? How do you remove line breaks from the Gutenberg texts? What is the best way to link to a book? Can I volunteer for the book project? Texts and Books How do I view the DJVU books? DJVU is a open format for scanned documents. There are free readers available at: http://www.lizardtech.com/download/?x=2&p=1&o=1&titl=Download%20DjVu%20Browser%20Plug-in for windows, mac, linux, mac OS-X, solaris. Try it. We like this compact, searchable, good looking, and open format. What is the status of the Internet Bookmobile? Internet Archive's Internet Bookmobile is currently out of commission. How do I view the PDF books? Books that are available in PDF format require Adobe Acrobat. The software is free to download and use. How do I download a book in tk3 format? This is a beautiful format, and well worth trying. To download a reader for Windows and Mac (pre OSX) go to http://www.nightkitchen.com/download/reader/index.phtml What equipment does the Bookmobile use to print and bind books? You can find a list of all the hardware and software used in the bookmobile here: http://www.archive.org/texts/bookmobile-in_it.php You can also see a movie of a book being made here: http://www.archive.org/details/HowToMakeABookmov What is the directory structure for the texts? In order to store all the texts that the archive has, and will eventually acquire, the directory structure is: IDENTIFIER/IDENTIFIER.extension (tif, djvu, pdf) IDENTIFIER: Unique in Archive's collection, alphanumeric (URL safe), this is the original name adopted by the originating collection (alphanumeric characters and _-. Best if from 5 to 80 characters). One format is [title:8-16][vol:2][author:4][scanninglocation:0-4] EXTENSIONS: If the original files are tif files, then: IDENTIFIER_orig.tif: All the orginal tiffs are stored in the form of multi page tiff. Demoware windows viewer Informatik Image Viewer. If it goes over 2GB, then it is stored as a tar of singlepage tifs the directory named IDENTIFIER_orig_tif/IDENTIFIER_orig_XXXX.tif resulting in a file called IDENTIFIER_orig_tif.tar IDENTIFIER.tif: All the cleaned up tifs (usually cropped, despeckled, deskewed) are stored in the form of multi page tiffs. If it goes over 2GB, then it is stored as a tar of a directory named ./IDENTIFIER_tif/IDENTIFIER_XXXX.tif resulting in a file called IDENTIFIER_tif.tar If the original files are JPEG JP2 or CR2 files, then: All the original jpg files are used to make a zip file named IDENTIFIER_orig_jpg.zip where the names of the pages in the zipped directory are IDENTIFIER_orig_jpg/IDENTIFIER_orig_XXXX.jpg. If the resulting file is greater than 2GB (thus breaking the zip format until zip64 is common), then the file will be in tar format named IDENTIFIER_orig_jpg.tar . If the originals are jp2 or cr2 files, then substitute these extentions above. Similarly all the processed jpg files (cropped and deskewed) are used to make a zip file named IDENTIFIER_jpg.zip where the names of the pages in the zipped directory are IDENTIFIER_jpg/IDENTIFIER_XXXX.jpg. If the resulting file is greater than 2GB (thus breaking the zip format until zip64 is common), then the file will be in tar format named IDENTIFIER_jpg.tar In the case where there is a small jpg version of the files for on-screen access then a similar naming convention is used from the _orig.jpg version above, but with _200KB resulting in a file named IDENTIFIER_200KB_jpg.zip where the names of the pages in the zipped directory are IDENTIFIER_200KB_jpg/IDENTIFIER_200KB_XXXX.jpg. An equivalent version can be done with other sizes and different formats such as jp2. IDENTIFIER.djvu: A nifty open scanned book format created by AT&T Labs and enhanced by LizardTech.com enabling compression and ease of reprinting. This file will also be ocr'd to make the text searchable.( /djvu/bin/documenttodjvu --filelist.txt temp.djvu, /djvu/bin --ocr aatttt.djvu) IDENTIFIER_djvu.xml this is an xml version of the OCR output which has the word positions (as a bounding box). this is used for building the djvu file, and is used for searching the flip books, and maybe constructing a searchable pdf in the future. IDENTIFIER.pdf: Adobe acrobat format that is derived from the .tif file if present. IDENTIFIER.txt.tar.gz or .art.tar.gz: If there are OCR'ed text files associated with each page, these are tarred and gzipped in txt format or art which is sakhr format. IDENTIFIER_cover.doc or .sxw: cover of the book, some in legal and some letter. doc is Microsoft Word, and sxw is OpenOffice. IDENTIFIER_xxxx_bookplate.jp2 or .jpg: is the file that has a bookplate that acknowledges those behind creating the digital version. xxxx is the page that it will replace in the access formats. IDENTIFIER_meta.xml: This has the catalog data (title, author, publisher, copyright information) and information about the book found while scanning (size, who scanned it) stored in a dublincore-like XML format. IDENTIFIER_meta.mrc: This will be the MARC (Machine Readable Cataloging) records for the book which provides the mechanism by which computers exchange, use and interpret bibliographic information and its data elements make up the foundation of most library catalogs used today. IDENTIFIER_marc.xml: marcxml format of marc record IDENTIFIER_metasource.xml: where the metadata information came from (metadata about the metadata :) ). LEGACY FORMATS: This could be OTIFF | PTIFF | TXT. OTIFF: These are the original tiff images of the scans of the books. (to create multipage tifs we used a unix util: tiffcp OTIFF/*.tif aaattt_orig.tif) PTIFF: These are processed images (cropped,desqewed,depeckled) from the originaltiffs. TXT: These are the text files that have been created by doing Optical Character Recoginiton (OCR) on the tiff images. * We plan to eventually remove OTIFF|PTIFF|TXT directories. How do you remove line breaks from the Gutenberg texts? In Word use find and replace 3 times: Step 1. Find two paragraph markers - ^p^p Replace with a neutral character ~ or # or @ Step 2. Find one para markers - ^p Replace with a single space (This might take about 10-15 minutes on large files) Step 3. Put 2 para markers back in - find ~ Replace ^p^p What is the best way to link to a book? Every book in the Archive has an identifier. For example, RomeoAndJuliet. To link to the book, you should use the following URL: http://www.archive.org/download/RomeoAndJuliet Can I volunteer for the book project? Volunteers are welcome to come to our San Francisco location during business hours and help make books. These books are given out as calling cards and thank you gifts to help raise awareness to the Internet Archive. Please write to info at archive dot org for more information or to make an appointment.

Live Music Archive A recording I uploaded and marked 'no lossy formats' had them created (mp3, ogg, m3u, etc...) . How can I remove them? If you come across this situation and you are the uploader, click [edit] and then 'Update'. You should see the message \"Format Options Updated Successfully\". Within 10 minutes the system will create a \"_rules.conf\" file in the recording's folder. Then, the next time the system performs an automatic sweep looking for changes, it will notice the new rules file and remove the lossy files automatically. The sweep occurs approximately twice a day, so you should see the files removed within 12-24 hours. If you are not the uploader, fill out an error report letting us know that the derivatives shouldn't be there and an admin will remove them when they get to the error report. What is the Live Music Archive all about? This audio archive is an online public library of live recordings available for royalty-free, no-cost public downloads. We only host material by trade-friendly artists: those who like the idea of noncommercial distribution of some or all of their live material. Live recordings are a part of our culture and might be lost in 100 years if they're not archived. We think music matters and want to preserve it for future generations. The LMA draws strength from the members of etree.org and other online communities of music fans devoted to providing public access to high-quality digital recordings of tradable performances. Typically, recordings are made by the fans themselves. Recordings are preserved in \"Lossless\" archival compression formats such as Shorten or FLAC (MP3 is not Lossless) for highest quality preservation. Patrons may download from the LMA with the understanding that the artists still hold their copyrights. All material is strictly noncommercial, both for access here and for any further distribution. What are MD5 files? MD5 files contain checksums, strings of characters used to uniquely represent a file. These checksums enable users to verify that music files downloaded correctly. A recommended tool for creating these files is MD5summer. Please note that before uploading the MD5 created with this tool you should open the MD5 in a text editor and remove the top 3 lines so the first signature is now flush with the top of the file. What are FLAC files and how can I listen to them? FLAC stands for free lossless audio codec. It is an open source, lossless compression algorithm for digital music. It compresses music files to 50-60% of their original size, with no loss in quality. More FLAC information can be found on the FLAC sourceforge site and in this etree FAQ. If you upload FLAC filesets to the LMA, please follow the naming standards to help the checking program here. Directories should be named with .flac16 or .flac24 suffix, not .flac. Otherwise, the program will report failures. To listen to FLAC files: Macintosh: Download and install MacAmp Lite, a multi-format audio player, and then install the FLAC Plugin for MacAmp. Windows: Download and install WinAmp, a multi-format audio player, and then install the FLAC Plugin for WinAmp. If you would like to use FLAC with your Windows Media Player (WMP) download and install the Directshow Filters for Ogg Vorbis, Speex, Theora and FLAC. This will allow WMP to not only play .flac files but .ogg files as well. Linux or any other UNIX-based architecture: Download and copy \"libxmms-flac.so\" to your XMMS media player input plugins folder. What are FFP files? FFP files contain checksums, strings of characters used to uniquely represent a FLAC file. These checksums enable users to verify which particular source a file comes from. Why are there no shows by band X? We'd like to make sure that a trade-friendly band would not mind having their shows in the Archive for public download. The best way for us to find out is by getting permission from a band representative or by the band's having an explicit policy that covers this type of site. If there are no shows by the band, either we don't have enough of this information to go forward with archiving, they have declined participation, or we are ready to accept shows but no one has uploaded anything yet. (Also, see the band status FAQ). Trade-unfriendly bands will not be found in the Archive, nor will otherwise trade-friendly bands who have declined to have material archived here. Bands, see other relevant FAQs here and here. Patrons, see more about how you can help here. There's no setlist for this show - OR - The setlist does not match up with the number of files. Should I submit an error report? There has been an increasing number of shows uploaded to the Live Music collection without setlist information, or the setlist was not properly matched to the files. When you notice a recording like this, please submit an error report only if you have an updated setlist, or you are able to match the files up correctly. We would prefer that you do not submit error reports letting us know that there is no setlist - tracking down setlists for every concert and matching them up to the recordings is a monumental task that has grown beyond the capabilities of the small group of Archive.org admins. We would like fans that are familiar with each artist's material to help us with this project - in your error report, please give us specific instructions on what changes to make and we will do so. How do I burn FLAC files to CD as audio tracks? You will first need to convert the FLAC files to another format that your burning program is familiar with. Windows users can use the FLAC Frontend, to convert FLAC files to WAV files, which are suitable for burning programs. For Macintosh OS X users, Dan Greuel has created a tool called MacFLAC. How do I burn SHN files to CD as audio tracks? You will first need to convert the SHN files to another format that your burning program is familiar with. The following programs will convert SHN files to WAV files, which can be burned to a CD. More resources are listed in this FAQ. Macintosh: Download and install Doug Hornig's tool, appropriately titled, Shorten for Macintosh. Windows: Download and install Michael K. Weise's tool, mkwACT. Or, another good tool is Foobar2000 - make sure you get the \"Special\" version to have Shorten compatibility! Linux or any other UNIX-based architecture: Download and install shorten. What is the status of band X for the Archive? 5/2006, significant site changes in progress: Formerly, you could check on the status of a band relative to the Archive on the Trade-Friendly Band Information page, which is no longer updated. This FAQ question has been updated for the new-system presentation of info. We have 3 categories: May be Archived- Band sections have been activated by Archive admins. Shows can be hosted here to the extent permitted by the band. Click on the band name and then through to their Policy Notes link to see what limits they may have placed on taping, trading or archiving. Pending- When a patron sends us information about having contacted an additional trade-friendly band, the new band is considered to be \"Pending\". Admins will update notes we keep on the band based on the information that people send to etree at archive dot org. (Sensitive parts of the info- such as email addresses used- will not be posted in the public notes.) Important: Under the new system, we cannot create a \"collection page\" for the band name unless and until we know that the band May Be Archived. Further, no shows may be uploaded for any band in advance of a band section's activation. Under the new system, there is no temporary \"upload area\" to store filesets for bands whose sections are not prepared yet. Please send shows for bands on the active list only. Opted Out- Some bands that may be otherwise trade-friendly may have explicitly said, \"No, thanks\" to our project. We respect their wishes. We still keep notes of their taping/trading policies for reference. If your favorite band name is not in any of these 3 categories, there are several possible reasons: They may not be trade-friendly in the first place. No one may have contacted them yet. Someone who contacted them may not have informed us yet. The band may not have written us back yet. If a band did write to us, we may not have had a chance to activate a section yet, or we may not have received enough information back from them to setup their section. In some cases, we may not have received the email successfully, so that a resend may be necessary. Bands, see other relevant FAQs here and here. Patrons, see more about how you can help here. I'm an artist who would like to be included in the Archive, what do I need to do? We'd love to have you! Just write to us at etree at archive dot org in English giving some kind of permission for us to archive your shows for public download and noncommercial, royalty-free circulation. It does not need to be a formally worded declaration, and can come from anyone you feel has the \"say-so.\" We just need to be clear on how you feel about the project. We will put relevant quotes onto a new \"collection\" page (examples) for your performances, along with a link to your official website. It is necessary for you to email us at etree at archive dot org in order to create a new section. We want to be sure that the go-ahead really is coming from you. Please do not attempt to create your own collection, or to upload any of the band's shows, in advance of receiving an emailed confirmation message from curators; such attempts may significantly complicate or delay the curators' setup process. You can give as much or as little scope for archiving as you like. Some bands place limits on what can be hosted, and we can accomodate those. Archive Curators, volunteer fans who have proven to be in line with the spirit of this archive, will attempt to screen contributions for OK'ed material only. At the same time you give the go-ahead, feel free to pass along any notes or policy links on your general taping/trading stance as well. You don't need to have a formal written or posted policy before inclusion, but we'd like to know how you feel about the topic. Besides fans' sending their copies of your shows, you can also prepare and upload your own live recordings to the Archive, if you like. In fact, if you'd like to limit your material to selected contributions from you only, please just let us know. If you have any questions about the project, please ask us anytime at etree at archive dot org. Can I upload concert videos? At this time, video uploads are not being accepted, namely because most of the bands archived prohibit the video taping of their shows. Moreover, unlike audio, where we actually have a shot at archiving the vast majority of any given band's live concerts (in very high quality format), video is scarce and, unless made by the artist (in which case, it's typically for commercial purposes), is not of particularly good quality. The progress of my upload says 'File metadata XML invalid. Waiting for user to correct.' How can I fix this? This is typically caused by illegal symbols being used somewhere in the information that was put into one of the forms submitted with the show (either the import form or \"File Options\"). Double check that the only characters being used are those visible on a standard English-language 104 key keyboard. More information and a few examples are here. If you have trouble finding the cause, please post to the forum for help. An admin will have to resubmit the recording for another try, so please send an email including a link to the recording to etree AT archive DOT org if you believe you have cleared the issue. More information on what XML files are and how they are created can be read here. I have more Live Music Archive questions...who do I ask? Feel free to email etree at archive dot org with any questions, and we'll do our best to post the answers here as soon as possible. Also, the message board is a great resource; with so many kind, knowledgable folks out there, you can often get a speedy answer to your question. I have a different source for a show that is already in the archive, should I upload it anyway? Yes! In keeping with the nature of this Archive, it is appropriate for multiple sources of the same show to be available for download. When you upload the new source, be sure to name the source in the show's top level folder to avoid confusion. Some bands do place limits on the types of sources allowed (such as soundboard recordings), so please check the policy for any given band. How can I help get bands into the Live Music Archive? If you know of a trade-friendly live-performing band that is a good candidate for the Archive, you can initiate contact. Some tips and letter templates can be found here. When you write, make it clear you are asking about the Live Music Archive at archive.org. Don't just ask about their general taping/trading stance. We want bands to know what's up. Next, follow up with a message to etree at archive dot org. Mention when you tried to contact the band and what contact point you used. These are important in order to update our contact records. Admins will update the contact status in an announcement forum about Pending Bands based on the message you send us. If you receive a reply from the band, positive or negative, send a complete copy of the email, complete with its sender's address/brief header info, to etree at archive dot org. It's a good idea to send a copy of what you asked them as well (if not quoted in the reply), since it will give context to the answer. We need to have full info in hand in order to set up the band appropriately in the Archive, and we may need to contact them for followup questions. If you are hesitant to make contact yourself, you can mention the band to Archive admins (send email to etree at archive dot org) and they can try a contact as time permits. To help out, supply any contact or policy info you may already know about the band. When I download concerts, I constantly get disconnected before the download completes. What can I do to fix this? If you are downloading large files from the collection with your Internet Browser and experience trouble maintaining a reliable connection to our servers, we recommend that you use FTP instead (File Transfer Protocol). Almost all FTP clients will allow your download to resume if the connection get broken. In addition, many will allow you to set up a queue of files that will automatically reconnect and resume when it notices that the transfer has stopped. For a list of recommended free FTP clients, see this FAQ. What are the WAV MD5 files that are sometimes in filesets? MD5 checksums files are not exclusive to SHN files. An MD5 checksum can be used to ensure the accuracy of any data file (e.g. .doc, .mp3, .mpeg). Some seeders produce MD5 checksums for their WAV files, as well as for their SHN files. This is just an extra level of confirm to ensure exact copies of the original WAV files are being burned from the SHN files. Checking a WAV file with a MD5 cheksum is no different than checking a SHN file. If you use mkwACT, you can just right click on the wav MD5 and choose \"verify.\" I just uploaded a directory that contained WAV MD5 checksums, is that OK? The WAV MD5 checksums are ignored by our robot and will not cause problems for your recording. My failure email is indicating that the text file failed. What can I do? Unlike FLAC or SHN, text files do not translate identically from 1 platform to another. Since the archive.org servers run Unix, text files created on other Operating Systems will fail their MD5check. We recommend uploaders remove any text files from their MD5's if they are having this problem. When I try to connect to a server via FTP, I get the error 'connection timeout.' How can I fix this? This error is caused by a setting in your FTP client, that limits the amount of time your FTP client will wait for a server to respond. In order to fix this problem, increase the \"server timeout\" setting; a setting of 180 seconds should be enough time to connect to the archive.org servers. If you use SmartFTP, the \"server timeout\" setting can be found in Tools > Settings > Connections. Can bands place restrictions on material to be archived? Yes. Each band can tailor the extent of their permission to the Archive. We quote the band's wishes in the Rights section of the band's Collection page. Here are some examples of special restrictions bands have requested. We point out different cases in a band's policy information using a shorthand \"Limited Flag\" tag. We have a contribution system set up to accomodate individual bands' requirements. During the upload process, contributors are urged to double check the band's policy notes at different stages. Archive Curators, volunteer fans who have proven to be in line with the spirit of this archive, will attempt to screen contributions for OK'ed material only. In addition, access to a particular item can be removed if it becomes restricted later (for example, a date newly chosen for commercial release must be removed under some band's policies). Bands, please contact us at etree at archive dot org anytime to let us know how we can work with you to make things happen. I just uploaded a show and all the files fail the MD5 check, what's the deal? Check to make sure the FTP program you used to upload the files is set to \"binary\" mode. If you try to upload .shn or .flac files in \"ASCII\" mode the files will fail the MD5 check. ASCII is the standard format for encoding plain text files (actually a subset of binary), while binary is used to encode almost all other types of files. More information on binary vs. ASCII can be found here. If this does not solve the problem, be sure that all the file names in the MD5 file match the .shn file names. Be aware that the UNIX system the Internet Archive runs on is case-sensitive. If you upload FLAC filesets to the LMA, please follow the naming standards to help the checking program here. Directories should be named with .flac16 or .flac24 suffix, not .flac. Otherwise, the program will report failures. Where have all the Dave Matthews Band concerts gone? Will they be back? At the request of the band's management and as a result of the band's 2003 policy change, Dave Matthews Band concerts (as well as Dave Matthews solo concerts and Dave and Tim shows) have been removed from the Internet Archive. We're very sorry about this unfortunate turn of events but feel like it is important to honor the wishes of the band and its management. For more information and discussion see this post: http://www.archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=3670 Why is there no Phish? What about Widespread Panic? Phish has decided not to participate in the Archive at this point in time. Their official response can be viewed here. Similarly, Widespread Panic has opted out of the project for the time being. They were last contacted on 11/9/2004. Their response can be seen here. I used to use a download manager and now it stopped working. What's the deal? Download managers increase your download speed by connecting to the server multiple times. Doing this does not significantly increase download speeds but dramatically hurts the performance of the server. If you wish to use queue to download from the HTTP servers, be sure you set your download program to only use one connection at a time. What's the deal with magic number errors? If you get a magic number error when listening to or decoding a SHN file, the SHN file is most likely corrupt. First, make sure the SHN file passes MD5 verification; if it does not, redownload the file. If the file passes MD5 verification and you are still getting the magic number error, leave am error report via the show details page noting the magic number error and which track the error occurs on. Hopefully others who have download the show will confirm or deny the error. If the error occurs for all downloaders, the seeder will be contacted to provide a new, uncorrupted track. Please note that there is nothing the Internet Archive administrators can do about a magic number error, becuase the only solution to the error is re-encoding the SHN file from the original WAV file. Do you provide an RSS feed of new updates to the LMA? Indeed! The URL of the feed is http://www.archive.org/services/collection-rss.php?mediatype=etree&collection=etree You can plug this into a front end like AmphetaDesk (available at: http://www.amphetadesk.com) What does the 'Transferred by' field mean? This field indicates the person who did the original DAT/MD/Cassette to WAV conversion. Also, note that in the case of recordings made directly to laptops there is no transfer. Why don't I get an email when my uploads fail MD5 checksums? The system currently only sends emails when MD5 files are included. This means that, if you're uploading FLAC files, you still need to generate and include an MD5 file if you want to receive informational emails about the failures. A recommended tool for creating these files is MD5summer. Please note that before uploading the MD5 created with this tool you should open the MD5 in a text editor and remove the top 3 lines so the first signature is now flush with the top of the file. Can I log into an FTP server to download concerts? Yes, you can log into iaXX.us.archive.org (where XX is a number), with the username anonymous and use your email address as the password. Each recording's details page will have a link for FTP that will tell you which number server the show is on, and in which directory. Here is a thread with an example. My in-progress upload says ' No metadata describing files found. Waiting for user to enter metadata' - what do I do? There are 2 XML files that get created during the import of any recording in the collection: showfolder_meta.xml showfolder_files.xml The first file gets created when you submit the import form to the collection. If that file does not exist, you can create it by editing the details page and clicking Update. The second file gets created by filling out File Options. Just click the link on the left side of the details page and fill out the form as accurately as you can. If either of these files are missing, your Contribution may give you this message. Please note that once the files get created, it takes 5-10 minutes before the system notices them and moves on to the next stage. Can I upload live recordings that were broadcast on XM Radio or Sirius Satellite Radio? At this point in time, Archive.org cannot host recordings that were broadcast over either of these services. Subscribers have informed us that they were required to sign a \"Terms of Use\" document that forbids the recording/hosting/rebroadcasting of any material received from these services. Until we hear otherwise, these recordings cannot be hosted here. The Grateful Dead is here, when will we see Jerry Garcia recordings? The taping policy of the Grateful Dead does not extend to recordings of Jerry Garcia's other lineups. Jerry's solo work is controlled by his estate. Representatives have said No to the idea of hosting shows in the Live Music Archive. Regarding removing the lossy files ... I edited my show, checked the box to remove them and clicked update. Now when I click update again, the box is still not checked. Why? It takes 2-10 minutes for your checking of that box to 'stick' ... see this discussion board post: http://www.archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=22816 for an explanation of why. The upload instructions require a 'FLAC Fingerprint' file with my recording - how can I create this? In Windows: 1. Open FLAC Frontend 2. Drag all of the FLAC files of your recording into Flac Frontend window. (you can also use the \"add\" button to do this) 3. Click the \"Fingerprint\" button. 4. Save the fingerprint file with a name like this: bandYYYY-MM-DD.ffp I've got a great 'filler' for the recording I am about to upload to the collection - should I include it? A 'filler' is music from a different performance in addition to the main recording, typically used to fill up extra space on a CD. Sometimes the filler is a different artist, other times it is the same artist, but a different show and date. While this is convenient for burning full CD's, it is not appropriate to include fillers on recordings here in the collection since they get filed under the artist and date of main performance. Please only include the performance for the artist and date you are importing. Fillers should be filed under their own entries elsewhere in the collection. Where can I find other recordings by [trade-friendly band] that aren't in the collection? If the artist is OK with Internet trading, you may be able to find downloadable recordings through http://bt.etree.org or http://www.furthurnet.net. Also, check http://db.etree.org to find people who have copies of shows and who may be willing to trade. Etree.org has additional trading forums at http://forums.etree.org Lastly, you can check out a band's own fan forums and mailing lists. Good luck! In contrast, the Live Music Archive forum at the Internet Archive is not a good place to post about trades, or to ask for shows that are not yet archived here, whether or not the band presently has a section here. Moderators may delete these posts. More posting etiquette tips for that forum are here. What are SHN files and how can I listen to them? SHN stands for shorten. It is a lossless compression algorithm for digital music. It was developed by SoftSound and it compresses music files to 50-60% of their original size, with no loss in quality. See this FAQ. To listen to SHN files: Macintosh: Download and install MacAmp Lite, a multi-format audio player, and then install the Shorten Plugin for MacAmp. Windows: Download and install WinAmp, a multi-format audio player, and then install the ShnAmp Plugin for WinAmp. Linux or any other UNIX-based architecture: Download and install the xmms-shn plugin for the XMMS media player. I tried downloading a show and I got a '403 Forbidden' page. Why? As part of the new (as of May 2007) QA/QC checks that the archive conducts on shows that are uploaded, more refined checks are conducted on shows. For more detail, see this forum post: http://www.archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=124098 What happens though, when a show either fails it's md5 check, it's internal flac checksum check, or is missing an info.txt file, every non .xml file in the show fileset (the flac files, the mp3's, etc) all become non-downloadable. If you try and click any of the music files, you will be taken to a webpage titled \"403 Forbidden\" that will say: \"Forbidden You don't have permission to access \"ARCHIVE.ORG_Server/show_location/file\" (specific to your show file) on this server. **** What this means is that the uploader has a problem with their show files, and as a measure to 'stop the spread' of bad files, the system is preventing people from downloading until the uploader contacts the archive to fix the show. If you as a user find a show that has the above problem, please check back later and once the uploader has fixed the problem, the show will be downloadable as normal. How do I upload a show to the LMA? As of 5/2006, the upload method has changed significantly. Here is a walkthrough in PDF with screenshots. Another text description is here. Before uploading any show, read the band's policy notes for this site. Many artists place limitations on their material here, and info is often updated. Please do not upload shows for any band that does not yet have a curator-created collection page here, even if you know the band has recently emailed their permission. Advance attempts may significantly complicate or delay the curators' setup process for the band. Next, be sure that you are logged in as an Internet Archive member. Have the fileset on your computer already, correctly prepared and correctly named. Files must be in lossless format (.flac or .shn), from lossless parent source material; we will optionally create the extra \"lossy derivative\" copies (.mp3, .ogg) onsite. Prepare to create an item, following example tips here or here. How do I make corrections to shows? Sometimes people make typos or other mistakes on uploads, or leave gaps in info that can be filled in later. You can help supply good information for archived items. Here is the current best method to submit corrections: If you uploaded the show, you can make the changes to the details page yourself. Make sure you are logged in as the user who uploaded the show and go to the details page of the show you are trying edit. Click on the \"edit\" link next to the band name at the top of the details page and you will be able to edit the show details including venue, location, source, setlist, etc. Be aware that editing these fields will only change the show details, not the files themselves. 5/2006 update: If you uploaded the item and would like to replace or add to files within your item, under the current system this can be done without reuploading the entire fileset. More description may follow; meanwhile there is a walkthrough as a Word document with screenshots. Specifically to fix your items derived between 5/11-22/2006 that sound too fast in the onsite flash player (chipmunk problem), see this PDF document with screenshots. If you did not upload the show, please click the 'Report Error' button and state concisely and precisely what the problem with that particular show is (If the problem is a missing setlist, please see this FAQ). If there are one or more missing or broken files that you can provide, please re-upload and re-import the entire show under a new directory name, and then hit 'Report Error' for the old, broken show, asking for that show to be removed. What file formats are accepted for contributions to the Live Music Archive? Currently, the Live Music Archive will only accept audio files in either of two lossless formats: FLAC (.flac) or Shorten (.shn). Please Note that MKW files (.mkw) are *NOT* an acceptable file format for your contributions because they lack cross-platform compatibility (Mac users are unable to play or decode MKW files) In addition, please do not upload the lossy files (MP3 or OGG) next to your FLAC or SHN format files - the Archive creates those files automatically, provided that the contributor agrees to having them available. This ensures that all the files here have uniform quality options selected. Please follow etree.org's Seeding Guidelines when preparing your contributions for addition to the collection. Pay particular attention to the Naming Standards section. A well-named identifier helps patrons find your show in our large collection. A well-named set of files allows files to be listed in the proper order at the site, and allows patrons to listen to them in playlists and burn them to CD in the proper order, too. I like adding concerts. Do you have a preference on the way I put in information? First of all - thank you so much for contributing to the Archive. Yes, here are some guidelines that will help us maintain good records for each concert. Do not include HTML in the source and lineage fields. Do not repeat information in the notes fields (such as source information, or number of discs). Only include information in the notes fields that is not already in any other field. If at all possible, keep absolutely nothing but song names in the setlist (even things like disc splits, set splits, etc. should not be in this field). If possible, putting all song names on one line, separated by commas is wonderful. Do not fill in unknown field with questions marks or N/A - just leave them blank. The exception to this guideline is the venue, setlist and source fields (which are mandatory) - in the event that this information is not known, simply write \"unknown\". Once again, thank you so much! About Grateful Dead concerts on the Archive Audience-made Grateful Dead concert recordings are available as downloads while available soundboards are accessible in streaming format only. The Grateful Dead is being separated from the Live Music Archive into its own collection (with its own forum) to avoid confusion about lossless availability. The metadata and reviews for shows and recordings, even those not available for regular download, will remain available for those who maintain direct links. No filesets have been deleted from the Archive; certain items are simply not public now. Prior to our completing the changes, text files are easily referenced at a separate database. At this time, the Grateful Dead collection is not open to public uploads. The Grateful Dead Internet Archive Project (GDIAP) will continue its direct management of this collection for the time being. As far as we know, there has been no change to standard GD fan trading. It is common for bands to have policies that differ between fan trading, versus archiving here. What are the options for streaming a full recording? Hi-Fi: An MP3 playlist, readable by most players, that has the addresses of MP3 files encoded with a variable bit rate. Lo-Fi: An MP3 playlist, readable by most players, that has the addresses of MP3 files encoded with at a constant bit rate of 64 kilobits per second. These files are ideal for users with slower Internet connections. What are the options for downloading a full recording? Update 5/2006: Please note that due to a major system transition, many items' ZIP files (for their \"Lossless\" links) have been deliberately disabled for the time being. Engineers are still working on the best method for the new system. Lossless: A ZIP file containing Shorten files or Flac files. Unlike formats like MP3, lossless formats are true to the original - there is no degradation in quality. Hi-Fi: A ZIP file containing MP3 files encoded with a variable bit rate to deliver high quality at roughly 160kilobits per second. Lo-Fi: A ZIP file containing MP3 files encoded at a constant bit rate of 64 kilobits per second. These files are ideal for users with slower Internet connections. FTP: Using an FTP client you can log in to the Archive's servers and download all of the files at once. Other Web Options: All files are displayed as individual links on any item's details page. Web-based download managers can be set up to download all the files you want from the page, as a group. For Firefox, the extension DownThemAll is a popular option.

What is the nonprofit status of the Internet Archive? Where does its funding come from? Does the Archive issue grants? How do I contact the Internet Archive? The Internet Archive What's the significance of the Archive's collections? Societies have always placed importance on preserving their culture and heritage. But much early 20th-century media -- television and radio, for example -- was not saved. The Library of Alexandria -- an ancient center of learning containing a copy of every book in the world -- disappeared when it was burned to the ground. What is the nonprofit status of the Internet Archive? Where does its funding come from? The Internet Archive is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. It receives in-kind and financial donations from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to: Alexa Internet, the Kahle/Austin Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and you. Does the Archive issue grants? No; although we promote the development of other Internet libraries through colloquia, and other means, the Archive is not a grant-making organization. How do I contact the Internet Archive? General questions about the Internet Archive should be addressed to info at archive dot org. For technical assistance and information please see the FAQs and search the forums. Questions What software can play the downloaded movies? Why do I get errors when I try to play a movie? Can I use these movies in FinalCutPro -- in the Quicktime format? Sometimes when I play a movie, the video is choppy or very pixelated. Why is that? Who owns the rights to these movies? Is there a discussion list about the movies?

How do I make DVD's from Internet Archive movies? How can I make a DVD using linux? Can I upload this movie? What kind of movie file should I submit? How can I embed a flash player with my movie on my web page? Movies What software can play the downloaded movies? VLC Media Player is the most versatile player we've found for playing the wide variety of movies found in the Archive. And, it's free! We also recommend MPlayer. For Windows: MPEG1 (VCD) most players; MPEG2 (DVD) freeware VLC, shareware player from http://www.elecard.com, or for-pay quicktime6 plugin: http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/mpeg2playback/ ; MPEG4 quicktime6 from www.apple.com or VLC . Latest flash plugin for browsers. For Mac OSX and 9: MPEG1 (VCD) most players; MPEG2 (DVD) freeware VLC ( http://www.videolan.org/ ) the for-pay quicktime6 add-on (see http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/mpeg2playback/ ). MPEG-4 Quicktime6. Latest flash plugin for browsers. Some Mac users have written to us suggesting MPlayer (OS X), BBDEMUX, and MPEG2DECX -- free on www.versiontracker.com. For more details, troubleshooting, and how to play movies on other operating systems, see this how-to page. Why do I get errors when I try to play a movie? The best all-around, free player is VLC Media Player - it handles most of the movie files you will find on this site. If you're seeing errors when you try to play movies, please try downloading VLC and using that instead. This clears up many people's problems. Here are some other possible problems: There is heavy traffic to our site. If you experience a delay, please try again later or at a different time of day. You're behind a firewall and the firewall software is attempting to modify incoming bits. Contact your network or firewall administrator. Your Internet connection went down or timed out. Check with your ISP or network administrator to see if there's a special policy about keeping a connection live. If your browser seems to hang after a \"100% downloaded\" message, check to see that you have sufficient hard-disk and TMP disk space. Rebooting the system sometimes helps. You are trying to play an MPEG-2 file on a platform other than Windows or Linux. At present, you need VLC ( http://www.videolan.org ) or the for-pay quicktime6 add-on to play MPEG-2 files on the Macintosh. Please contact us at info at archive dot org if you have information about other players that work on platforms other than Windows. 2. Your player tried to stream the movie, and it isn't streamable. Download the movie first, and then play it. (Right-click > Save As) 3. Some conflict exists between your computer's configuration and the player you're using. Unfortunately, because PCs can be set up in so many different ways and because different standards exist for playing video, finding a player that will work is a hit-and-miss process. Try Rod Hewitt's evaluations of a number of players. If you still have trouble, post your question to the moving images forum. Can I use these movies in FinalCutPro -- in the Quicktime format? You can Re-encode Mpeg2 movies to quicktime for FinalCut Pro using Cleaner5.0.2 using the following settings. There is no de-interlacing, so you don't lose anything. The files increase in size 10 fold, so make sure you have enough HD space. This procedure gives you quicktime movies suitable for use with final cut. Cleaner 5 -- if you don't have 5.0.2, you can download.0.2 from the terran.com site. - output > quicktime, .mov - tracks > process everything - image > image size constrain to 720*480, display size normal, do not deinterlace, field dominance-SHIFT DOWN - encode > apple DV-ntsc codec, millions of colors, spatial quality 100%, frame rate, same as source - Audio > we're still not sure about which is best. start with mono, 48kb, experiment. Some have had good results with their decoder cards. compare a few films done both ways on a good monitor with scopes and see which method is best.If you still have trouble, post your question on our discussion list (moviearchive-subscribe@yahoogroups.com) or write to us at info at archive dot org. -- NEW -- One of the simplest ways to transcode movies from MPEG-2 to DV format for editing is to use the freeware utility MPEG Streamclip (Mac OS X and Windows) available at squared5.com. It offers many settings and maintains video/audio sync. Sometimes when I play a movie, the video is choppy or very pixelated. Why is that? Try downloading the movie to your computer and watching it locally. Sometimes choppiness occurs when we can't stream it to you quickly enough (because your connection is slow or our servers are overloaded). If you're watching an MPEG-4 that we derived from an original MPEG-2, we first reduce its size to 320 x 240 - a quarter of the resolution of NTSC video. We then translate it at 350 kbps, which is really borderline for that resolution. You see errors occasionally because there simply isn't enough bandwidth available, so the MPEG-4 encoder either drops frames - resulting in jerky or choppy motion - or drops macro blocks - resulting in blurred or pixelated video. That is the price we pay for the small file size - 80 MB for a 1/2-hour clip is really very small in the digital video world. If this is the case, download the original MPEG-2 to solve the problem. Who owns the rights to these movies? This will vary for practically every movie in the archive. We are endevouring to make it easy to understand what you can do with these movies, but this is a work-in-progress. Many of the movies and collections are licensed with Creative Commons Licenses. If the movie has a CC License, it will be noted on the movie's detail page. Click on this link to find out exactly what the permissions are for that particular film. Some films may have the contact information listed for the filmmaker. If the information is provided, feel free to contact the filmaker or organization the film comes from. If there's no license, you should assume that the only thing you're allowed to do with it is watch it. Is there a discussion list about the movies? Yes Ã¢â¬â our list is about both movie content and technical issues. You can subscribe at moviearchive-subscribe@yahoogroups.com. Are there other similar archives on the Web? There are many sites that allow users to upload videos, but most of them only display very low quality video and/or do not let you download the videos. As far as we know, this is the only site that presents high-quality downloadable movie data files with such liberal use restrictions. See the Links page at Prelinger Archives for a number of sites that may be useful to researchers or those seeking specific films or footage. What are those animations associated with each movie and how did you make them? The animations on the details pages and on the browse pages are animated GIF files. In most cases, still shots from each minute of the program were grabbed and saved as JPG files (these are the thumbnails which you can reach by clicking on the \"View thumbnails\" links). Then a tool called ImageMagick was used to create the animated GIF files from the JPGs. We try to create an animated gif for every movie when it is uploaded (it may take a while to appear), but there are some file formats and/or encoding settings that make this difficult. If an animated gif hasn't appeared for your item by the day after you uploaded it, we probably couldn't make one for your item. Can I stream the movies? There are several programs you can use to stream movies in the Archive. Because we allow users to upload video files in any format, the same player will not always work for every single file, so it's a good idea to have a couple of programs available that you can try. Also, some files simply can't be streamed. Usually, this happens when the program that created the video file uses a codec that our software doesn't understand. So if you click on a stream link and get an \"unsupported media\" sort of error, use the download links instead. Here are some free players that might come in handy: Quicktime If you have Quicktime installed, many mp4 streaming movies will play right in your browser window just by clicking a stream (or download) link. Make sure you have the latest version so that you can play the widest array of files. VLC Media Player Open your VLC Media Player and go to File > Open Network Stream. Click the File tab and enter the download link of the file you want to watch. Yes, this seems backward, but it works! So, if you were trying to stream the movie Duck and Cover found at http://www.archive.org/details/DuckandC1951 you would: Use this URL: http://www.archive.org/download/DuckandC1951/DuckandC1951_256kb.mp4 NOT this URL: http://www.archive.org/stream/DuckandC1951/DuckandC1951_256kb.mp4 VLC will stream mp4, avi, mpg and other file formats, so it is quite useful for viewing the majority of the files in the archive. Real Player You can use Real Player to stream Real Media files. We support two bitrates: 32Kbps-192Kbps for modem and ISDN users plus 256Kbps-450Kbps for DSL and cable-modem users. Encoding Parameters We attempt DVD, VCD, and MP4 streaming for broadband. We want these parameters to easily work with low-end video editors. MPEG-2, DVD -- 720x480 or 702x480 interlaced. With a system header on each pack to be compatible with DVD. (Prelinger movies are 1/2 D1 352x480 29.97 fps which causes some players to make them look skinny) MPEG-1, VCD -- Video Resolution SIF (352 x 288 PAL, 352x240 NTSC) Framerate 29.7 or 25 for PAL Video Compression MPEG-1 Video Bitrate Up to 1151 kbps constant bitrate (CBR) Audio 224 kbit/sec MPEG-1 Layer2 Stereo 44.1khz Created with ffmpeg. MPEG-4 -- 512Kbps h.264 VBR 320x240 video with 64Kbps AAC audio. Hinted for streaming. Created with ffmpeg and mp4creator. What is an editable file? An editable file is a file which can be downloaded and used in an editing program. The MPEG-4 are the highest bitrate versions we could do with the linux mpeg-2 to mpeg-4 conversion tools we use. These files can be read directly into FinalCut-Pro from Apple, and can be converted to mov using Quicktime-pro and read directly into iMovie from Apple. How do I make DVD's from Internet Archive movies? Please read this forum posting about how to create DVDs from many of the movies found in the Archive: http://www.archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=26467. If you have further information to add, please email us. How can I make a DVD using linux? An Archive user sent in the following instructions for creating DVDs on a linux system: To do this under linux from the command line: This requires a few common programs. Using any modern package distribution of linux installing these should be quite simple. mplayer (http://www.mplayerhq.hu/) transcode (http://www.transcoding.org) mjpegtools (http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net/) dvdauthor (http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/) The first command copies just the video out of input.mpeg and produces output.video: mplayer input.mpeg -dumpstream -dumpfile /dev/stdout | tcextract -t vob -a 0 -x mpeg2 > output.video The second command copies just the audio out of input.mpeg and produces output.audio: mplayer input.mpeg -aid 128 -dumpaudio -dumpfile output.audio The third command combines the video and audio back together again in a format ready for dvdauthor: mplex -f 8 -V -o complete.vob output.video output.audio This step creates the dvd structure. Create a new file with any text editor with the following: <dvdauthor dest=\"DVD_folder\"> <vmgm /> <titleset> <titles> <pgc> <vob file=\"complete.vob\" chapters=\"0,15:00,30:00,45:00,60:00\"/> </pgc> </titles> </titleset> </dvdauthor> The chapters line lists the points to include chapter marks on the DVD for jump navigation. Now let dvdauthor create our dvd: dvdauthor -x dvdauthor.xml Done! You should now have a folder called \"DVD_folder\" with your movie. You can create an ISO or BIN image with mkisofs: mkisofs -dvd-video -V \"Movie Title\" -o movie.iso DVD_folder/ You can play movie.iso in most any video player or burn it to a DVD: growisofs -speed=16 -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvd=movie.iso If you just want to burn the film to a DVD you do not have to create the movie.iso image file: growisofs -speed=16 -dvd-video -dvd-compat -V \"Movie Title\" -Z /dev/dvd DVD_folder/ Can I upload this movie? You may upload movies that you own the copyright to, or that are in the public domain. We are not copyright lawyers, and copyright is a tricky business, so you may want to consult a copyright researcher to clear material before you use it. You may also want to check this list of movies that one of our volunteers has already researched. Here is some general information on the subject that may help you decide if your movie is okay to upload. The information below applies to films produced in the United States only. 1) Is there a copyright notice visible in the film? It is usually visible with the title or at the end of the film. If the work was made in 1923 or earlier, it is probably public domain and can be uploaded. NOTE! Restored versions of the film or new soundtracks for silent films can have more recent copyrights that are still valid - usually a copyright notice for a new soundtrack or restoration will appear in the film. For works made from 1923 to 1949, post a question to the movie forum on this site before you upload. The copyright could have been renewed and there isn't a way online to check a film's copyright status. For works made from 1950 to 1963, you can check the title at the Library of Congress Copyright Database for copyright renewals: http://www.copyright.gov/records/cohm.html . This will list copyright renewals for most films. If the copyright notice is 1964 or later, the copyright is probably still valid and the film should not be uploaded unless you are the copyright holder. 2) Is the copyright notice in the correct format? It needs to state three things - the word 'copyright' or the copyright symbol or '(c)', the year and who owns the copyright? If it is missing one of those elements or if there is no notice, it could be public domain. If you aren't sure, please post a question to the movie forum on this site. 3) Is the film foreign (not from the U.S.)? Foreign titles might not have a copyright notice, but still may be copyrighted in their country of origin. Traditionally the U.S. wouldn't recognize the copyright of a foreign film unless it was registered in the U.S. That has recently changed with the GATT treaty. Many foreign works had their copyrights restored. Please post a question to the movie forum on this site about these films before you upload. What kind of movie file should I submit? The archive is all about free access to information, so you should submit file formats that are easily downloadable and/or streamable for other site patrons. We prefer that you submit the highest quality format that you have available, and then we will attempt to create smaller file sizes and formats automatically with our deriver program. MPEG2 files are the easiest file type for us to deal with. We recommend that you do not attempt to do any special encoding of your files - the more settings you mess around with, the less likely our deriver code will be able to process the file. Whatever format you choose, please upload each file to your item individually, in a non-compressed format. Uploading content in a .zip or .rar file makes your item unstreamable and significantly less accessible to others. If you upload .zip, .rar, non-video formats (like .exe), or password-protected files, they may be removed by our moderators. The table below describes what file formats we will attempt to derive depending on what type of file you submit. How can I embed a flash player with my movie on my web page? It's really easy to embed our flash player with your movie into your web site. To do so, go to the item page for the movie you want to embed. Then click the flash player as if to watch the movie. When you do, you'll see a small question mark beneath the player. Click on this and you'll get the instructions and code you need to embed the movie into your web page. Questions Can I download files via FTP? What are some good FTP clients for downloading files from the Archive? How do I download files? Downloading Content Can I download files via FTP? Yes - via anonymous FTP. We highly recommend using FTP to download large files. On the item's details page, look for the \"FTP\" link next to \"all files\" on the left side of the page. Click the \"FTP\" link and you'll see all the files listed and the ftp address where you can find them. Open your FTP program, connect to that ftp address, and then download the file you want. The advantage of using FTP is that it will usually handle a service disruption gracefully. If it gets interrupted, when the service is back it should resume the download where it left off. What are some good FTP clients for downloading files from the Archive? While HTTP is more popular, some users find their downloads are much more stable with FTP. Here are a few FTP clients that users have found to work well: For Windows Users Filezilla (support open source!) SmartFTP FTP Commander For Mac Users Cyberduck (support open source!) Transmit Fetch Interarchy How do I download files? To download the files on a PC, right click the link to the file, and select \"Save Target As\" or \"Save Link As\" (or something similar depending on which browser you're using). On the Macintosh, hold the button down while the mouse is over the link, and when the menu comes up, select \"Save Target As\". You may want to use FTP to download very large files. Questions Why not Squid or mod_proxy? Why FreeCache? Why not BitTorrent? What files are being served by FreeCache? What's a good download manager? FreeCache Why not Squid or mod_proxy? Both Squid and mod_proxy are great for reducing the load on web servers, and we encourage everybody to use them. The disadvantage of these caching proxies are that they only work \"vertically\", i.e., they reduce the bandwidth downstream from the originating web site to the users' browsers. That web site still gets 1 download per (non-cascading) proxy. The FreeCache system works more \"horizontally\", i.e., FreeCaches fill themselves up from neighboring FreeCaches if at all possible. Hence, the load on the originating web site is much lower. FreeCache and caching proxies are complementary technologies. Both can be used to reduce the impact on web sites. Why FreeCache? FreeCache is a demand-driven, distributed caching system. Cooperating caches exchange files without burdening the original site too much. Why not BitTorrent? BitTorrent is good and similar to FreeCache in that it balances download \"horizontally\". BitTorrent uses other BitTorrent clients for this balancing; these clients often become un-available after a particular file is not popular anymore. The FreeCache system utilizes permanent FreeCaches that don't go away (although particular files get flushed out after a while). Unlike BitTorrent, the FreeCache system is transparent to the end-user. No new client or server software is required, and the files do not need to be converted. To offer a file via the FreeCache system, all you need to do is prefix the URL with http://freecache.org/ What files are being served by FreeCache? FreeCache can only serve files that are on a web site. If the link to a file on that web site goes away, so will the file in the FreeCaches. Also, there is a minimum size requirement. We don't bother with files smaller than 5MB, as the saved bandwidth does not outweigh the protocol overhead in those cases. What's a good download manager? We like wget, because you can tell it to play nice and go slow. It's highly configurable and very powerful. Wget runs on all Unix platforms (incl. Mac OS X), and it comes standard with Cygwin on Windows. If you prefer something graphical, Mozilla's built-in download manager works fine. Questions What is DocuComp? What do I need I to know to use DocuComp in the WayBack Machine? What Archive Pages are comparable? Why should I compare results of past Web pages? Where can I find out more about DocuComp? How are images compared? Some images are missing in my comparison? Certain links or actions are not working in the comparison results? How can I report problems? Can I copy and use my results? Guidelines for Press, Magazines and General Media DocuComp What is DocuComp? DocuComp is a sophisticated technology that compares inserted, deleted, replaced and moved text and content in Web pages. It's patented algorithm has been specially designed and licensed for use in the Wayback Machine. What do I need I to know to use DocuComp in the WayBack Machine? You only need to know the basic functions of the Wayback Machine. Begin by typing an URL into the Wayback Machine and hit the 'Take Me Back' button. Once you've found your choices on the results page, click the 'Compare Archive Pages' button in the upper right hand corner of the page. The reloaded page will have a series of check-boxes before each page date. Check any two dates and select the 'Compare two dates' button in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. The system is designed to automatically generate results for any URL's indexed by the Wayback Machine. What Archive Pages are comparable? You can compare any two pages from the Archive's library dating from 1996 to the present (approximately 55 billion pages). Why should I compare results of past Web pages? Access to the Archive's Collections is provided at no cost to you and is granted for scholarship and research purposes only. The DocuComp feature is intended to provide interesting insight into how content on pages in every field-- from the government to entertainment to business sites-- changes over time. Where can I find out more about DocuComp? Please visit the ww.docucomp.com site. DocuComp is a widely-used technology that is licensed by it's parent company, Advanced Software, into many of the software products and content management systems available today. Formerly a standalone application for Advanced Software, the company now focuses exclusively on licensing the DocuComp technology and patent to software vendors. How are images compared? When compared pages contain different images, only the new (or latest) set of images is shown. Images that were either changed or removed are not displayed in the comparison results. Some images are missing in my comparison? In certain cases, images within the Web pages are not available. Not all images are archived nor are retrievable from the original site. If they no longer exist on the original site then the images will not be available and not displayed within the archived pages. Certain links or actions are not working in the comparison results? Links to other pages may not be live if those pages (or links) no longer exist and are not in the archive library. Also, javascript enabled links and actions are disabled in the comparison results to prevent errant scripts from being run. How can I report problems? After comparing two pages, the upper frame on the results page includes a hyperlink to report results which return any page faults. By clicking this hyperlink, an automatic error report is generated to both the Internet Archive webmaster and DocuComp's technical team. If you wish, there is an additional help screen to describe the issue. Please keep in mind that with over two billion pages to index and compare, not all being created alike; some pages will differ greatly and not have a common frame of reference to effectively compare. Can I copy and use my results? The results of any comparison done on the Internet Archive site are governed by the terms of use listed at: http://www.archive.org/about/terms.php. Additionally, any use of the DocuComp trademark or logo without express written permission by Advanced Software, Inc and any of it's affiliates is prohibited by law.

Questions How did you digitize the films? An article on re-coding Prelinger Archive films to SVCD so you can watch them on your DVD player. Do I need to credit the Internet Archive and Prelinger Archives when I reuse these movies? Do I need to inform the Internet Archive and/or Prelinger Archives when I reuse these movies? How can I get access to these movies on videotape or film? What parameters were used when making the Real Media files on the website? Are there restrictions on the use of the Prelinger Films? Can you point me to resources on the history of ephemeral films? Why are there no post-1964 movies in the Prelinger collection? Prelinger Movies How did you digitize the films? The Prelinger Archives films are held in original film form (35mm, 16mm, 8mm, Super 8mm, and various obsolete formats like 28mm and 9.5mm). Films were first transferred to Betacam SP videotape, a widely used analog broadcast video standard, on telecine machines manufactured by Rank Cintel or Bosch. The film-to-tape transfer process is not a real-time process: It requires inspection of the film, repair of any physical damage, and supervision by a skilled operator who manipulates color, contrast, speed, and video controls. The videotape masters created in the film-to-tape transfer suite were digitized in 2001-2003 at Prelinger Archives in New York City using an encoding workstation built by Rod Hewitt. The workstation is a 550 MHz PC with a FutureTel NS320 MPEG encoder card. Custom software, also written by Rod Hewitt, drove the Betacam SP playback deck and managed the encoding process. The files were uploaded to hard disk through the courtesy of Flycode, Inc. More recently, Prelinger films have been digitized and uploaded by Skip Elsheimer at AV Geeks. The files were encoded at constant bitrates ranging from 2.75 Mbps to 3.5 Mbps. Most were encoded at 480 x 480 pixels (2/3 D1) or 368 x 480 (roughly 1/2 D1). The encoder drops horizontal pixels during the digitizing process, which during decoding are interpolated by the decoder to produce a 720 x 480 picture. (Rod Hewitt's site Coolstf shows examples of an image before and after this process.) Picture quality is equal to or better than most direct broadcast satellite television. Audio was encoded at MPEG-1 Level 2, generally at 112 kbps. Both the MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 movies have mono audio tracks. To convert the MPEG-2 video to MPEG-4, we used a program called FlasK MPEG. This is an MPEG-1/2 to AVI conversion tool that reads the source MPEG-2 and outputs an AVI file containing the video in MPEG-4 format and audio in uncompressed PCM format. We then use a program called Virtual Dub that recompresses the audio using the MPEG-1 Level 3 (MP3) format. This process is automated by the software that runs the system.

If you require a written license agreement or need access to stock footage in a physical format (such as videotape or a higher-quality digital file), please contact Getty Images. The Internet Archive does not furnish written license agreements, nor does it comment on the rights status of a given film above and beyond the Creative Commons license. We would appreciate attribution or credit whenever possible, but do not require it. Can you point me to resources on the history of ephemeral films? See the bibliography and links to other resources at www.prelinger.com/ephemeral.html. Why are there no post-1964 movies in the Prelinger collection? Because of copyright law. While a high percentage of ephemeral films were never originally copyrighted or (if initially copyrighted) never had their copyrights properly renewed, copyright laws still protect most moving image works produced in the United States from 1964 to the present. Since the Prelinger collection on this site exists to supply material to users without most rights restrictions, every title has been checked for copyright status. Those titles that either are copyrighted or whose status is in question have not been made available.

Can I see a list of the most downloaded audio files? Can I search by Creative Commons License? Search Tips Can I see a list of the most downloaded movies? Every collection within Moving Images has a \"Most Downloaded\" list in the right-hand column of the page. However, if you'd like to see a complete list of all of our most downloaded movies, click here. Can I see a list of the most downloaded audio files? Every collection within Audio has a \"Most Downloaded\" list in the right-hand column of the page. However, if you'd like to see a complete list of all of our most downloaded audio items, click one of the links below: All Audio Items (not including Live Music Archive). ALL Live Music Archive concerts LMA concerts (without the Grateful Dead) Grateful Dead only Can I search by Creative Commons License? Yes, you can. But it's a little complicated. Here's how to break it down. See the license types at creative commons. When you want to find all of the items that have a certain license, you'll plug their abbreviation for it into this search query: /metadata/licenseurl:http*abbreviation/* So if you're looking for Attribution Non-commercial No Derivatives (by-nc-nd), you'd put this in the search box: /metadata/licenseurl:http*by-nc-nd/* And you'd get about 33,000 items back. If you want to use this in combination with other queries, like \"I want by-nc-nd items about dogs\" you'd do this: /metadata/licenseurl:http*by-nc-nd/* AND dog And you'd get 195 items. The AND tells the search engine all the items returned should have that license AND they should contain the word dog. AND has to be in all caps. Just to make it easier, here are the basic searches: Public Domain Attribution Non-commercial No Derivatives (by-nc-nd) Attribution Non-commercial Share Alike (by-nc-sa) Attribution Non-commercial (by-nc) Attribution No Derivatives (by-nd) Attribution Share Alike (by-sa) Attribution (by) Questions How can I add my music, movies, or text?

I'm having trouble uploading via FTP. What tips can you give me? How should I name the files for movies I upload? During upload, I get an error message about 'illegal characters' or 'file name prohibited.' What does this mean? How can I use accented or special characters in my title or description? What kinds of formats do you want me to use for uploading? How should I name the audio files I upload? How can I take my files off the site? Why am I having trouble uploading files with Internet Explorer 7? I just uploaded my files, and I got an error message that says there's a problem with my metadata - but I haven't added any metadata yet! Uploading Content How can I add my music, movies, or text? You may contribute content to the Internet Archive if it's in the public domain or if you own the rights to it. If you own the rights, we recommend that you choose a Creative Commons license for it so that others will know how they may (or may not) use it. The easiest way to contribute movies, audios, or books to the archive is to use our new uploader tool. Click the \"Upload\" button near the upper right-hand corner of the site, or click here. You can also contribute items using our old upload method. You can track the progress of your items in our catalog. How to upload via our old upload system: Go to http://www.archive.org/create.php?ftp=1 Type in the item identifier you'd like to use (e.g. gt556) and click the \"create item\" button Wait a few moments for the item to be checked out. This is the checkout page - don't close it! Once the item's checked out, you'll be given ftp information about where to upload your item. You can either use an FTP program to do this, or use Internet Explorer for windows. When you're done uploading, make sure you check the item back in! There's a link on the checkout page that will check it back in for you (or, if you're using IE, click the \"Click here when done\" link in your ftp window). Choose a mediatype and collection Enter metadata Wait about 10 minutes for your item to go live It will take several hours for your item to show up in the search engine. We accept audio, video, and text files. I want to add LOTS of individual items to the archive, how do i do that? If you have a large collection of related items in single media type, like a radio show for example, please contact the Internet Archive. You can email our collections staff at info at archive.org. Be sure to include the details of your collection; we want to know how many items you have, what format they are in as well as any general information you can give us about the collection. How can I report an error for my item? First, we recommend that you search the Forums. Many common problems have already been answered there, and you'll have an answer much more quickly. If that doesn't work, go to your item's details page and click the \"Report errors\" link in the lower left box. Enter details about the problem you are experiencing - the more details you provide, the more easily we can help you. How can I make changes to my item? If you want to change your item's metadata (like title, description, file formats and titles, running time, language, etc.) make sure you're logged in, go to your item's details page, and click the \"Edit item\" link in the lower left box. If you want to change the files in your item (remove files, upload new/more files, rename files, etc.), you'll need to check the item out and access it via FTP. Click \"Edit item\" in the lower left box Click \"Item Manager\" at the top of the page Click the \"checkout\" button Use the FTP information on the checkout page to access your files. Do not close this page until you have checked the item back in. Make your file changes Check the item back in (there is a check in link on the checkout page) Wait 20-30 minutes for your changes to appear. If you have uploaded new files and you want us to make derivative files (smaller, more compressed versions), you will need to do one more thing. Click \"Edit item\" Click \"Item Manager\" Click the \"derive\" button Can you tell me a bit more about choosing a license? From the Creative Commons website: \"Creative Commons licenses help you share your work but while keeping your copyright. Other people can copy and distribute your work, but only on certain conditions.\" You can choose a license to associate with your contribution and this license will be linked to when users see the details page. I'm having trouble uploading via FTP. What tips can you give me? If you've having trouble using IE7, see the IE7 FAQ below. When uploading files that are not just text (such as sound files, movies, or images), be sure that your FTP client is in BINARY mode (or at least in automatic mode). Every FTP client is different, but usually this setting is in the connection settings. If you cannot connect to the FTP server: Make sure you've correctly entered the server you want to connect to (the checkout page will have a specific server listed, like ia331116.archive.org). Be certain to use your email address (the one you use to log into this website) as your username, and your website password as the password. If you still have trouble connecting, post to the forum with the error message you get, and someone will help you. How should I name the files for movies I upload? Take for example a movie called My Home Video. The identifier (AKA base name) for this movie should be something like MyHomeVideo. The naming convention for the files depends on the encoding. MPEG-2: MyHomeVideo.mpeg MPEG-1: MyHomeVideo.mpg DivX: MyHomeVideo.avi QuickTime: MyHomeVideo.mov Windows Media: MyHomeVideo.wmv Real Media: MyHomeVideo.rm MPEG-4: MyHomeVideo.mp4 If you know the bitrate of the encoding (for QuickTime, Windows Media, Real Media, or MPEG-4), please include in the file name as such (using 64 as the bitrate and QuickTime as the format, for example): MyHomeVideo_64kb.mov During upload, I get an error message about 'illegal characters' or 'file name prohibited.' What does this mean? The folder or files that you are attempting to upload have characters in the name that cause problems with the system - so we have designated them \"illegal\". This includes the following characters in the name: * ( ) { } [ ] / \\ $ % @ # ^ & | < > ' ~ ` ! ? + In addition, files and folders may not have spaces in their names. You will need to remove any of these illegal characters by renaming the file(s) in order for the system to accept your contribution. How can I use accented or special characters in my title or description? You can use accented and other special characters in your item text and file titles, but you need to make sure you use the xml-safe code for those characters instead of typing them directly into the forms. Typing accented characters directly into forms can break the xml for your item, making your files unavailable through the site. Instead, you'll want to use a special code to represent those letters. There are some examples in the table below, but you can find a complete listing of these codes on wikipedia - you'll use the number in parentheses in the \"Unicode code point\" column. Here are some common accented and special characters and what you should replace them with: To Make This Character... Replace It With This Code & &#38; à &#224; À &#192; á &#225; Á &#193; è &#232; È &#200; é &#233; É &#201; ñ &#241; Ñ &#209; ü &#252; Ü &#220; So to write the word café you would actually write caf&#233; - you replace the letter é with the code &#233; There are many, many more codes than the ones listed above, of course. You can find more at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references. What kinds of formats do you want me to use for uploading? The Internet Archive strives to archive content in open formats that are friendly to long-term storage and access. In addition to affecting long-term storage and access, giving us media in these formats will assure that they are accessible now, since many problems with long-term accessibility such as DRM and propriatary codecs also cause problems today. However, if you have content that is not available in an open/recommended format (see below), we will still happily archive it. Our systems are not tied to specific media formats and in fact are capable of archiving any type of digital data that can be represented as a file. Format Recommendations: We encourage users making contributions to the Archive to create as high quality versions of their media as possible. As we know access is important and not everyone has a high speed connection, we will take these archivable copies and create much smaller version for users with slow connections. Remember, a WAV file may seem big, but it won't be in 5 years. Further, you can always make lower quality files (e.g. mp3s) from higher quality files, but cannot go the other way. For video we typically recommend MPEG2 (DVD quality), or if you do not have MPEG2, MPEG1 or MPEG4. For audio we recommend WAV or FLAC (preferably 24 bit). For text we recommend plain text, xml, or pdfs. How should I name the audio files I upload? Take, for example, an audio called My Music. The identifier for this audio should be something like MyMusic. The naming convention for the files depends on the encoding. MP3: MyMusic.mp3 WAVE: MyMusic.wav Flac: MyMusic.flac Shorten: MyMusic.shn Ogg Vorbis: MyMusic.ogg Windows: MyMusic.wma Real Media: MyMusic.ra If you know the bitrate of the encoding, please include it in the file name. For example: MyMusic_64kb.mp3 How can I take my files off the site? If you would like us to take down an item you have posted, please send an email to iasupport [AT] archive [DOT] org. Please include the exact URLs of the items. Your email must come from the same email address you used to upload the item. This is the only way we can tell that you are the owner of the item. Why am I having trouble uploading files with Internet Explorer 7? IE7's FTP functionality is different from IE6. After you create your item, you'll get to the checkout page where you receive a link to the FTP server to use for your upload. When you click that link in IE6, you are taken directly to screen that allows you to drag and drop your files to upload. In IE7, you'll see a screen that lists files as links. You cannot drag and drop onto this screen. So, after you click the FTP link on our site, hit \"page\" > \"open FTP in window,\" wait for the error message, click \"ok\" and then select \"file\" > \"login as\". Enter your archive email and password and the folder with the familiar icons appears. You can now drag and drop your files as usual. I just uploaded my files, and I got an error message that says there's a problem with my metadata - but I haven't added any metadata yet! When you create an item, we \"check out\" a directory for you to upload files into. When you're done uploading, you \"check in\" the directory (by cicking a link on the check out page, or clicking the \"click here when done\" icon). Checking in an item lets us know you're done uploading, and the first thing we do is back up your files to a second server (so we'll have two copies of everything). Sometimes, when it's taking longer than usual to complete this backup, you'll get an error message that says there's a problem with your metadata. If you wait a little while (usually just a few minutes, but occasionally longer), you should be able to continue the upload process without any trouble. If you uploaded metadata with your files, or you've gotten this error after you've added metadata (title, description, file titles, etc.) then you may have a problem. Usually an item breaks because you used special characters that broke the xml files for your item. Please feel free to use the link on the error page to report the problem to us and we'll try to help you fix it. Questions How can I make links clickable in my posts? How can I format text in my posts Forums How can I make links clickable in my posts? You may have noticed that some posts have highlighted links in them. Internet Archive forums permit the use of HTML codes. Suppose you want to make a link to the Internet Archive home page, one that looks like this: Internet Archive home page. To do this, you would enter the following HTML code: <a href=\"http://www.archive.org\">Internet Archive home page</a>. How can I format text in my posts Since the Internet Archive forum system accepts HTML codes, you can make text bold, italic, underlined, or even colored by using normal HTML codes. See WebMonkey for a list of HTML codes. Questions I forgot my password, what can I do? When I attempt to log in using my username and password, I am told that the username or password is invalid. What could be wrong? What is the difference between a virtual library card and an account? How do I change my password? How do I change my screen name? What happens to my forum posts and movie, software, audio, and book reviews when I change my screen name? What happens if my email address changes? How can I change my email address? How can I remove my account? Virtual Library Cards (AKA Accounts) I forgot my password, what can I do? As long as you remember the email address which you originally used when signing up for your virtual library card, you can use this form to have your password emailed to you. Bear in mind that your password will be sent in clear text, which means that anyone who views the email (or anyone with sophisticated \"packet sniffing\" software) can obtain your password. For this reason you should return to the Internet Archive website once you have your old password and change it to something new. When I attempt to log in using my username and password, I am told that the username or password is invalid. What could be wrong? There are several things to keep in mind when you encounter this error. Your username is your email address, not your screen name. Make sure you enter the same email address that you supplied when signing up for your virtual library card. Your password is case-sensitive. Check to see if the CAPS-LOCK key is engaged (typically a light would be illuminated on your keyboard). You might have forgotten your password. If you think this is the case, you can have your password emailed to you here What is the difference between a virtual library card and an account? These two terms are used interchangably. How do I change my password? You can use this form to change your password. How do I change my screen name? You can use this form to change your screen name. What happens to my forum posts and movie, software, audio, and book reviews when I change my screen name? Your old reviews and posts will be updated with your new screen name. What happens if my email address changes? How can I change my email address? You can use this form to change your email address. However, be aware that if you change the email address for your account, you will no longer be able to \"edit\" files posted from your old email address. If you would like to have your items' ownership transferred to a new email address, send an email to iasupport AT archive DOT org from your OLD email address (the one you want to get rid of - that's how we know you own the items) and tell us which address you'd like to change it to. How can I remove my account? You can use this form to remove your account. Questions How can I connect to SFLan? I live at 123 Main St at Crossing; do I have line of sight access to a node? What is the cost of a node? How can I get a node? If I get a node, can my neighbors connect also? What is included in the node? What are the power requirements of a node? What are the connection characteristics of the network? What is the percentage of uptime? What about IP addresses? I still have more questions, what should I do? SFLan How can I connect to SFLan? With a laptop: Be in the vicinity of a SFLan node. Associate with it: The SSID is sflanNN, where NN is the number of node, e.g. sflan13. No WEP. You'll get an IP number assigned via DHCP. With a house: Contact us at info at archive dot org. (Please include your address and a phone number.) Find out if you have line of sight to another SFLan node, buy a node, and we'll put it on your roof. I live at 123 Main St at Crossing; do I have line of sight access to a node? Go to our map at: http://woody.archive.org/nagios/cgi-bin/statusmap.cgi and see how close you are to an existing node. Also you can try something like netstumbler or kismet to look for a SFLan ssid. What is the cost of a node? The nodes cost $1100, which includes the price of parts and installation. Discounts are potentially available depending on the location. How can I get a node? Send an email with your name, exact address and phone number to info at archive dot org. Be sure to write \"SFLan node\" (or something similar) in the subject line. The information will be passed on to our fantastic installation team who will contact you. If I get a node, can my neighbors connect also? Yes, a SFLan node can connect your neighbors and co-condo association members. What is included in the node? Most of our nodes are composed of two radios, but some have three. The components are in a weather tight box with a four foot coax cable and two antennas attached. The whole unit is mounted on your roof (generally) on a pole. There is a picture of our lovely 5'3\" spokesmodel holding one here: http://www.archive.org/iathreads/uploaded-files/AstridB-PICT0017.JPG What are the power requirements of a node? A node takes on average 5 watts. What are the connection characteristics of the network? There are no average characteristics, but 2MBs shared among 20 or so people would be an example. What is the percentage of uptime? SFLan is an experimental network, so the uptime varies. Right now uptime averages around 90% or more. What about IP addresses? SFLan uses real, routable IP addresses. These are usally given out dynically via DHCP. The nodes themselves use static addresses. We can also assign static addresses for servers. For the techies: We use tunneling, layer 2 and layer 3 bridging in parts on the network to make it all appear as a \"flat\" LAN. There are pros and cons about this approach. It has worked best for us so far. However, it is a moving target, and might change in the future. I still have more questions, what should I do? SFLan is a work in progress. If you have more questions, try the SFLan forum. If you still need help, write to info at archive dot org. New Post FAQ Forum Subject Poster Replies Views Date Exhausted all choices for locator URLs.

[George Samuel Newth was brother to Kate NEWTH born c1846 Shropshire, Brother to Anne Elizabeth NEWTH born Mar 1844, registered Madeley Shropshire (Who married Samuel Edward BUTTENSHAW (1871) a secretary Islington), Brother to James Aldridge NEWTH Born Jun 1847 Plymouth, Devon - died 10 Aug 1923 Lane Cove Sydney buried Waverley cemetery (NZ)]. This book (one of 5 books by G S Newth published by Longman, Green & Company of London, England) first appeared in 1898. Another book 'Inorganic Chemistry' (the most popular and remembered) was first published in 1894 (although the earliest copy I have seen was 1896) and which was revised and reprinted many times (with author updates to 1923), the final version appearing in 1940. Old copies can be found for sale quite reasonably priced from internet book suppliers. It has been reported of John D R Thomas past president (1990) of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 'Analytical Proceedings, July 1990, Vol 27 p161 that his interest in chemistry derived from his father’s 1913 edition of G. S. Newth’s “Elementary Practical Chemistry-A Laboratory Manual for Use in Organized Science Schools,”. Herbert Marcus Powell's (1906-1991) biographical details [Biog.Mems. Fell. R. Soc. Lond. 46, 425-442 (2000)] include a poem he wrote about chemicals (The Chemists Dream) which included the lines - \"I awoke upon a grassy bank beside the river Pharpar In a scene that would have gladdened G.S. Newth or Bruce and Harper\"- Other books Newth had published included 'A Chemical Lecture Experiments' published first in 1892 and 'Elementary Practical Chemistry' first published 1896 which was for school chemistry classes. This book was called 'Elementary Inorganic Chemistry' when sold in the USA. 'Smaller Chemical Analysis' published in 1906. was his final book. An American, George D Timmons had a book published in 1912 (Longman Green and Co) called 'Questions on Newth's Inorganic Chemistry' which is hard to find outside of the British Library (BL system number 003640330). Newth also had a number of papers published. For example: \"An apparatus for showing experiments with ozone. GS Newth Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions 69, 1298-1299, Royal Society of Chemistry, 1896. and \"Notes on partially miscible aqueous inorganic liquids\" J. Chem. Soc., Trans., 1900, 77, 775 - 778. Another paper gave an improved method for producing ethylene in the laboratory. Jour. Chem. Soc., 1901, 79, p. 915 George Samuel Newth was also in his youth a keen cyclist and his name appears in a copy of a US cycle magazine 'The Wheelman' under 'Wheel News' on page 234 in 1883 when he was challenged to a race. \"Mr. G. S. Newth, of New College, Hampstead,has accepted Mr.Wilson’s “Faed’s”challenge to riders of the “Otto” for a road race, in order to test the comparative speed of the “Otto” and the tricycle\". His wife was Margaret Newth and there is no record of any children. His name and address details can be had from UK Census records etc. Newth was a demonstrator in Chemistry at The Royal College of Science in London (now Imperial College) from the 1880s up to about 1910. He worked with other noted chemists including Frankland and W A Tilden. Newth's books are well worth buying and are a fascinating insight into late Victorian chemistry for schools and colleges and he was in many ways ahead of his time. George Samuel Newth died in Hythe, Kent, England in 1936.See my Wikipedia article. (D.Mullen, Liverpool, England).

Came upon this and read a few other reviews. I'm not a true deadhead but have followed them since 1966. This is like looking through a Windowpane into my younger years. Thanks to the GD, not all of my memories are blottered (sic) out. Reviewer: Zaorish - - April 24, 2008 Subject: This show is a DREAM The Grateful Dead. What the Hell? How do they just keep pulling f**king amazing stuff out of their asses???? Everyone knows 78 was a year in which shows had great versions of a few songs, but dragged a little in the second sets. Not so this one. EVERY SONG I LISTEN TO IS F**KIN' FLAWLESS. I thought that all He's Gones after 1974 sucked. No way. He's Gone is ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS. Drums rocks too, which is extremely rare for it. (SBD drums almost always sound like shit, because there's little or no echo) Other One is very hot at 15 mins, the show closes with a furious Round&Round, a standout version you can compare to 4-12-78 and 2-5-78. This show is excellent. And Scarlett>Fire rips hard, just as it usually does in 1978. This show is like all the great things about 1978, with none of the drawbacks. I consider myself a big '78 fan...how did I miss this one??!?!?! Anyway if you liked this, definitely get 12-19-78, the stella>nfa is a priceless moment.

Reviewer: IMPROVISATION - - April 21, 2008 Subject: Would love to know more Hey just saw your post. WOuld love to get turned on to more good 78's. I've been looking for a 74 show (i think) that has the best dark star-Me and my uncle transition I've ever heard. Reviewer: jeeper - - April 6, 2008 Subject: I NEED YOUR HELP!!! Howdy fellow archivers :~) So for the past year I've been downloading with no problem using Windows XP. I'm now using the new Vista and can't figure out how to \"get\" the downloads. Could somebody please help?! As far as this '78 show...ROCKIN'!!The slide work Jerry & Bobby use in the 1st set is awesome, especially in Stagger!!!\"The song that woman sung...\"---Thanks in advance if you can help out! Reviewer: dead-freak - - April 6, 2008 Subject: Best audience recording here!!!!! I have only begun listening to this amazing nugget. It sounds like the mics are sandwiched right in the heart of the sound. Great levels and high end. Weird that Jerry still sounds far away, but don't hesitate to dl this one. The whole show is fantastic. \"I knew w/o askin' she was into the BLUES!!\" After truly ingesting this show I do belive it is one of the tightest (to abuse a term) displays of symbiotic jamming of which ONLY this band is capable. The He's Gone through the other one is as organic as they come with a terrific thundering Phil intro for good measure and totally out of the blue like Jack Cassidy carrening to a bus stop where I got on...back in '86...oh lest I reminesce, this show smokes! The other one meanders with Jerry's quitessential filigree fret work. Then plunging into a lower register jam and noodling his way throughout the theme. He is expending harmonies and lets one know how close rock/jazz/blues are. All interwoven in a splendid tapestry of aural carpeting. I am so humbled to know a fellow Minnesotan developed this archive. Hats off to all involved! true heroes raviging the storied past of the greatest American band ever!!

Really well played, good song selection. Healey mix is perfect. The scene: I think it was the basketball schedule of the Warriors or something that threw off the usual 2 shows, rest day, 2 shows New Years' run this year. In any event, this was one of the few years that we only got three shows for the run. Like last year, Chard and I were here. No rain, unlike the year before, so we got a nice California vacation to break up the western NY winter. The music: I think this was a really strong show. Brent was really on (listen to USed to Love Her). The Bird Song is as strong as any from 89, IMHO. Fun, unexpected song selection from Jerry for the post-space block. As other have commented the UJB>Miracle>Foolish Heart segment is really sweet. Reviewer: barongsong - - April 20, 2007 Subject: downhill from here Was at all three of these shows and while New Years was probably the most fun, this to me is the most interesting of the three. Reviewer: Deadin87 - - October 14, 2006 Subject: Must've been the brownies This was my one and only NYE show and though I was there, I was in the lot for this show - a friend came along for the trip (not a Dead fan at all) and I gave him my ticket - call it witnessing for the Dead - he came out after show with this dazed look in his eyes and a huge smile from ear to ear - I all remember was he said Jerry was talking to him through his guitar during Bird Song...yep! I had forgotten to mention to him before the show that the brownies I had made, 3 of which he had eaten before the show, were \"special\". That just made my night! Reviewer: jboyaquar - - March 1, 2006 Subject: Good Gig 1st Set: A Pitter-patter \"Iko\" opens up the final run of 1988. It's certainly more appealing than the one in Long Beach. A smooth nicely paced \"Walkin\" \"Jack\" is as spiffy as the other tunes... not the most nuanced or with the largest degree of feeling, but it's tight. Wow, \"All Over Now\" is moving awfully fast. It's still a six minute song, but by the end of the tune I'm like an out-of-control toy wheezing around hysterically. \"Push\" builds to a crescendo that makes it above-average. 79 seconds of \"tuning\" precede a solid \"Memphis Blues.\" However, due to every tune being up-tempo tonight a change via a 'Desolation' might have been a keen change of pace. \"Bird\" is so magically intricate..everyone's on their own path but it's coalescing beautifully. \"Jack\" is shorter than the one in Long Beach but because the sound is clearer and the feeling is more emphasized, it's leaves a brighter resonance on my mind and a wider smile on my face. 2nd Set: 102 seconds of tuning, but we're it's apparent we're obviously getting \"China.\" Musically, it's exemplary, they're not creating magic...but everyone's adding their distinct piece to the puzzle. \"Rider\" is sturdy and both Bobby and Jerry shine in their respective spotlight parts. Bobby's in an awfully confident mood during \"Estimated.\" Then again, the band is sounding good, but check out his direct line-readings around 3:00. But, he's in rhythm. The following jam is defintiely evening, shmeared star material...not all that moody but provides an atmosphere of a vagrant rarely capable of nesting anywhere for a long while. Just about a stop/start but melodically a keen thru-line with \"He's Gone\" It broods sufficiently leading to a drawn out \"Drums\" and an especially twisted \"Space\" the bristles with oddball insinuations. Alien firelies buzzing around your head...kinda places me back watching the prequel to \"the Battle for Endor\" Wicket and the little girl driven to goofy frantics by the innocuous insect's wings. \"UJB\" is mild-mannered but fluid. This is really the first clean recording I've been privy to in about a week and a half. Then again, '88 was a minor step down after the spectacular energy of '87 shows. But they're transitioning back, at this stage, to a jammier band...hence the six minute running time of this \"Miracle.\" What a unique place for \"Foolish.\" Standard crisp version, Brent's active in the 6's and symbiotic guitar work in the 7's make it a winner. \"Lovelite\" is unmemorable til about 4:30 when Bobby screams out 'Wait a minute...\" and enters a 'Stranger'-like vocal outro. It comes down and then back up for a splendid if not explosive, time. 217 seconds of \"Crowd\" and tuning then a finely nuanced, almost vocally devestating \"Baby Blue\" closes out this quality show. 3 1/3 stars Reviewer: Terrapanda - - October 10, 2005 Subject: A GREAT UNDERRATED LATE 80s SHOW THAT WAS WORTH THE OTHERWISED CURSED 3000 MI. ROAD TRIP (one way) I too was at this show. With just a five-foot female friend between me and the barrier, just to Brent's side of Jerry, I pretty much had a religious experience at this show. You gotta love general admission. Almost every song in the first set is perfectly executed with that extra measure of Brent organ jam to stretch things out a little. As we speculated as to whether Bird Song would close the set, I remember a girl named Margot totallly called Jack Straw way out! Super solid China-Rider with a particularly inspiring, spotlit, arm in the air, wishin' he was a headlight, Garcia moment. The real highlight has to be Miracle!! That 's right. I said Miracle. After a sweet post space UJB, the jam into Miracle is very interesting. This is one of those moments when I remember being blown away at the time, 10 feet from the action, that totally holds up on tape. During the longish Jerry/Brent jam-out-of-Miracle-duel, Garcia almost falls over at one point he's rocking out so hard! I remember Garcia and Brent really seemed to be enjoying each others playing and in playful moods all night. This is post-coma, pre-MIDI, rock and roll GD at it's best. And check out the next night too for my favorite Samson. Reviewer: auggie - - April 27, 2005 Subject: Thank You Dead Hour I first heard the high points of this show on Gans's Dead Hour in the late '80's. Loved the Bird Song & Jack Straw too but what grabbed my attention was the Space>UJB>Miracle, especially the transition into Miracle, Garcia sounds very \"heavy\". When I saw Healy's name on the mix I was a little worried about it being unbalanced and heavy on the audience but it is actually very good though it could use some more Lesh for my ears. Of particular note is the drums are up front in the mix as is Brent's Hammond Organ. Well worth getting. Reviewer: lobster12 - - April 4, 2005 Subject: dig on it Great show. the jam out of Miracle is sweet. This is one show that straight to the point, no goofing around. They came to play Reviewer: redeyedjim - - January 31, 2005 Subject: Very solid show I was at this show and really liked it. The first set is strong, especially the Bird Song and set-ending Jack Straw. The Bird Song has some wonderfully trippy, Bralove-inspired soundeffects that are just a whole lot of fun -- ringing, pulsating tones that seem to come out of nowhere and really serve to take the song to a higher plane. Jerry, too, rises to the occassion and takes this song into some nice Dark Star territory. The band interplay is excellent and the tune has a wonderful sense of space and range, especially for a first set tuner in the first night of a three night run. I was lucky enough to see some 240 shows, and this was *by far* the best Bird Song I saw live. While not as trippy, the Jack Straw that ends the set just ROCKS -- tremendous energy, great climax. As the band tears into the main jam, they do so with a sense of purpose that and focus that will make you smile no matter what you're doing. The jam's peak is especially impressive -- everyone cooking, Phil dropping bombs huge bombs, and Jerry engaging in this wonderful interplay with the audience -- he does a perfect run of fast notes near the climax that just GOOSES the crowd, and the audience roars back LOUDLY in approval, feeding more energy back to the band. Fun stuff! They punctuate the jam with great authority, and when Bobby belts out the final verse, it's a screamer! Makes you wonder why this song didn't appear more often as a set closer. IMHO, the Birdsong and Jack Straw are the show's highlights, but the second set is still mighty fine. The Jerry tunes are rich with emotion, and you have to like a second set that features UJB out of space. If the second set had risen to the standard laid out in the Birdsong, this would be a solid five star show. The second set doesn't scale those heights, but is well played and thoroughly enjoyable. Well worth the download. Reviewer: Alpine7784 - - October 25, 2004 Subject: Another Brent Show If you enjoy Brent's B-3 playing, check out his solo on \"It's All Over Now\" in the first set. The man just played his ass off. I really, really miss him. Reviewer: will not fade - - October 22, 2004 Subject: BABY BLUE !!! By far, my favorite version of this tune. Great show besides, but this Baby Blue sends chills. On some versions the big guy in the black t-shirt just MEANT it, know what I mean? If you like this tune, this is waay my favorite. Been lookin' for one that comes even close, haven't found it. Anybody? Wish I could have been there. Arlo said it best... play it again, with feelin'. Probably the rock and roll quote that comes closest to describing how I feel about this music. How many bands really played with feelin'? Sorry, Loverboy doesn't count. And sorry for overstating it, but this version of this song is like top 5 Grateful Dead moments for me. What do you think?

Privacy Policy 10 March 2001 The Internet Archive (the \"Archive\") is committed to making its constantly growing collection of Web pages and other forms of digital content (the \"Collections\") freely available to researchers, historians, scholars, and others (\"Researchers\") for purposes of benefit to the public. The Archive offers access to some of its Collections mainly by allowing Researchers to access its Unix machines. This open approach is somewhat like the situation in a public library, where staff and patrons might see who else was in the library and a bit of what they were working on. When Researchers using the Collections log on to the same Unix machine using different accounts, some sharing of information may take place. While the Archive endeavors to enforce its Terms of Use (http://www.archive.org/terms/index.html) and maintain standard computer security, it is important for both those who visit the site (\"Visitors\") and Researchers (collectively, \"Users\") to be aware of the open nature of the Archive. The Archive may make changes to this policy from time to time and will notify you of such changes by posting an updated date in the Terms, Privacy, and Copyright link at the bottom the home page of the Archive's Web site (the \"Site\").

My favorite quote regarding this song is Blair Jackson's. I'm paraphrasing but it goes something like: \"Nobody wants to watch the Grateful Dead sing \"Let's get down and dirty baby/Let's get sweet and low. Ever.\" He also said it actually sounds like a below average Tubes song which, of course, is what it is. I'm convinced that during the last year of the Grateful Dead's existence Vince Welnick thought he was playing in The Tubes, as the idea of improvisation seemed to completely escape him. Listen to his comping on Slipknot! Then throw on a Brent version. Hey, I'll even be fair. Throw on a Brent version when Brent is blasted out of his mind and you'll hear better playing. I could never understand what on earth happened at the auditions for the keyboard player in 1990 that made him the choice over Pete Sears and other more copacetic players. I saw Sears a few years back and he would have been a perfect fit for them. Garcia NEVER learned Samba as far as I can tell. Now granted he wasn't much for learning anything by this point, including his lesson, but if you listen to the Oakland '94 show with Branford Marsalis you'll hear the sax player sail effortlessly through the changes that make up the instrumental break and actually make the song sound half way decent(the Garcia of 1989-91 could have done the same). It is, for me, the only one worth listening to. Even Garcia seems to show a little spark, egged on by his guest. At least he lets Branford play in this hsow unlike the sad spectacle of the late '93 Marsalis show. Hey what are we talkin' about, Syd??? This thread is all about Playing in the Band! And YES!! I think I could listen to that song for hours too. I have had a few experiences where I have been listening to the Dead with friends, and talking and socializing at the same time, and lost the plot, and had to ask if the band were still playin' Playin'. That's the sign of a really good Playin'. Wish I could see either Phil or Bob this summer. Oh well. Canada seems off the radar for the moment.

I probably would have hesistated had I known what I was in for, but thought this would be a good test project (and didn't you always want to see the G-Man get grilled?). I see this primarily as a portfolio piece, but hopefully you'll get some entertainment value out of it (or at least rent the movie). I feel that this is about 75% of what I wanted to accomplish. The animations are spotty in some areas and I need to make some of the expressions more fluid, but overall I think it's a pretty decent attempt (for a hobbyist). All of the camera cuts were done in the game (at least 15 point_viewcontrol entities). When you launched the level it went right into the movie and didn't stop until the end credits.

Valencia Gardens Housing, with 240 units, is the first area to be connected in a pilot project that expects to wire more than 2,500 units in the city in the next eight months, according to Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle. What makes the project unique is that the apartments will be connected to the Internet, and to the educational resources at the Internet Archive, at 100 megabits per second (Mbits/second). That speed contrasts sharply with the normal Internet service offered by telephone companies, which is usually less than 6 Mbits/second. The residents can instantly view DVD-quality videos of the thousands of lectures and other educational information from the Internet Archive's collections, as well as traditional Internet access. The Internet Archive is able to achieve this high speed by connecting the San Francisco municipal fiber optic network, which runs through the public housing developments, to an Archive switching center, which connects to the Internet. âWe are pleased to be the first non-profit organization to bring public housing online,â Kahle said. He added: âWe are excited to see much faster access to the Internet as a way to experiment with advanced applications, and are pleased that the underserved get first access to advanced technology.â NYtimes: http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/low-income-residents-get-high-speed-access/ NPR's OnTheMedia: http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2008/04/11/04 CNET: http://www.news.com/8301-13772_3-9904821-52.html ValleyWag: http://valleywag.com/373658/brewster-kahles-internet-archive-brings-broadband-to-sf-housing-projects This post was modified by brewster on 2008-04-14 05:24:10 Terms of Use (10 Mar 2001)",["http://www.archive.org/images/logo.jpg","http://www.archive.org/images/main-header.jpg"]]

When accessing an archived page, you will be presented with the terms of use agreement. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Archive’s Collections or its Web site (the \"Site\"). Access to the Archive’s Collections is provided at no cost to you and is granted for scholarship and research purposes only. The Archive, at its sole discretion, may provide you with a password to access certain Collections, provided that you complete any required application process and provide accurate information in your application. You may use your password only to access the Collections in ways consistent with this Agreement — no other access to or use of the Site, the Collections, or the Archive's services is authorized. You agree not to interfere with the work of other users or Archive personnel, servers, or resources. Further, you agree not to recirculate your password to other people or organizations or to copy offsite any part of the Collections without written permission. Please report any unauthorized use of your password promptly to info@archive.org. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Archive’s Privacy Policy and agree that the Archive may collect, use, and distribute information pursuant to that policy. If you provide any content to the Archive, you grant the Archive a nonexclusive, royalty-free right to use that content. Some of the content available through the Archive may be governed by local, national, and/or international laws and regulations, and your use of such content is solely at your own risk. You agree to abide by all applicable laws and regulations, including intellectual property laws, in connection with your use of the Archive. In particular, you certify that your use of any part of the Archive's Collections will be noncommercial and will be limited to noninfringing or fair use under copyright law. In using the Archive's site, Collections, and/or services, you further agree (a) not to violate anyone's rights of privacy, (b) not to act in any way that might give rise to civil or criminal liability, (c) not to use or attempt to use another person's password, (d) not to collect or store personal data about anyone, (e) not to infringe any copyright, trademark, patent, or other proprietary rights of any person, (f) not to transmit or facilitate the transmission of unsolicited email (\"spam\"), (g) not to harass, threaten, or otherwise annoy anyone, and (h) not to act in any way that might be harmful to minors, including, without limitation, transmitting or facilitating the transmission of child pornography, which is prohibited by federal law and may be reported to the authorities should it be discovered by the Archive. You agree that we may contact you from time to time with surveys or other questions regarding your opinions about and uses of the Archive, as well as with information we believe may be of interest to you. We encourage you to respond to these surveys because we value your input, which will assist us in improving the Archive. In addition, we request that, according to standard academic practice, if you use the Archive's Collections for any research that results in an article, a book, or other publication, you list the Archive as a resource in your bibliography. While we collect publicly available Internet documents, sometimes authors and publishers express a desire for their documents not to be included in the Collections (by tagging a file for robot exclusion or by contacting us or the original crawler group). If the author or publisher of some part of the Archive does not want his or her work in our Collections, then we may remove that portion of the Collections without notice. The Archive may immediately terminate this Agreement at its sole discretion at any time upon written notice (including via email) to you. Upon termination, you agree that the Archive may immediately deactivate any password it has issued to you and bar you from accessing the Collections or the Site. The Archive may modify this Agreement from time to time, and your continued use of the Collections and/or the Site constitutes your acceptance of any and all modifications. The Archive will attempt to notify you of substantial modifications via the email address that you have registered with us, if any. Because the content of the Collections comes from around the world and from many different sectors, the Collections may contain information that might be deemed offensive, disturbing, pornographic, racist, sexist, bizarre, misleading, fraudulent, or otherwise objectionable. The Archive does not endorse or sponsor any content in the Collections, nor does it guarantee or warrant that the content available in the Collections is accurate, complete, noninfringing, or legally accessible in your jurisdiction, and you agree that you are solely responsible for abiding by all laws and regulations that may be applicable to the viewing of the content. In addition, the Collections are provided to you on an as-is and as-available basis. You agree that your use of the Site and the Collections is at your sole risk. You understand and agree that the Archive makes no warranty or representation regarding the accuracy, currency, completeness, reliability, or usefulness of the content in the Collections, that the Site or the Collections will meet your requirements, that access to the Collections will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error free, or that defects, if any, will be corrected. We make no warranty of any kind, either express or implied. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Internet Archive and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, officers, directors, and employees from and against any and all liability, loss, claims, damages, costs, and/or actions (including attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Archive’s services, the site, or the Collections. You agree that this Agreement is governed by California law and that any suit arising from this Agreement will be brought in San Francisco, California, and you further agree that on the election and reasonable notice of either party any litigation shall be referred to arbitration pursuant to the California Code of Civil Procedure, §§1280 et seq. In addition, you agree that should any provision in the Agreement be found invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable, that provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions. Under no circumstances, including, without limitation, negligence, shall the Archive or its parents, affiliates, officers, employees, or agents be responsible for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from or in connection with the use of or the inability to use the Site or the Collections, or any content contained on the Site or in the Collections, or resulting from unauthorized access to the Collections or your transmissions of data, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, use, data, or other intangibles, even if the Archive has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so some of the above may not apply to you. This Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and other policies posted on the Site constitute the full and complete agreement between you and the Archive and are not intended to inure to third-party beneficiaries. We welcome your input. Please contact us with any comments or questions at info@archive.org. Privacy Policy 10 March 2001 The Internet Archive (the \"Archive\") is committed to making its constantly growing collection of Web pages and other forms of digital content (the \"Collections\") freely available to researchers, historians, scholars, and others (\"Researchers\") for purposes of benefit to the public. The Archive offers access to some of its Collections mainly by allowing Researchers to access its Unix machines. This open approach is somewhat like the situation in a public library, where staff and patrons might see who else was in the library and a bit of what they were working on. When Researchers using the Collections log on to the same Unix machine using different accounts, some sharing of information may take place. While the Archive endeavors to enforce its Terms of Use (http://www.archive.org/terms/index.html) and maintain standard computer security, it is important for both those who visit the site (\"Visitors\") and Researchers (collectively, \"Users\") to be aware of the open nature of the Archive. The Archive may make changes to this policy from time to time and will notify you of such changes by posting an updated date in the Terms, Privacy, and Copyright link at the bottom the home page of the Archive's Web site (the \"Site\"). Your continued use of the Site and/or the Collections constitutes your acceptance of any changes to the Privacy Policy concerning, but not limited to, both previously and prospectively collected information. What Personal Information May the Archive Have on Its Computers and Systems? Because the Archive uses standard Web logging in its Web servers, our Web server may automatically recognize the domain name of each Visitor, each Visitor’s IP address, what Web page the Visitor requests, and the time of the request, along with a variety of information supplied by the visitor’s browser. See www.microsoft.com and www.netscape.com for information about the Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator browsers, and see www.apache.org for details about Web logs. In addition, the Archive may collect the email addresses and messages of those who communicate with it via email or who enter email addresses in forms. The Archive may collect personally identifying information when a Researcher registers for access to the Collections, including the Researcher’s name, address, telephone number, and email address, and the Researcher’s proposal for using the Collections. The Archive may use \"cookies\" to track Users' activities on the Site and in the Collections. Cookies are small files that a server transfers to the hard drive of someone who visits a site and that the server can access when the person returns to the site. The primary sources of content for the Collections are publicly accessible Web pages that were collected and donated by third parties, but the Archive will expand on such sources through its own collection activities. For instructions on removing a particular set of pages currently included in the Collections, please see our policies and procedures for page removal. The communications between you and the Archive may pass through many machines, operating systems, programs, browsers, Web servers, networks, routers, Ethernet switches, Internet service providers, proxy servers, intranets, the public phone system, or other devices (collectively, \"Devices\") on your premises, at the Archive, and in between. Some of these Devices create logs of activities that are recorded on computer systems. What Might the Internet Archive Do With the Information on Its Computers? The Archive has no present intention to charge for access to the Collections. The Archive may transfer the information on its machines, including personally identifying information, into the Collections. The Collections are made available to researchers and may be made available on the Site, or provided to third parties, for any use, without limitation. For instance, parts of the Collections are now in the collections of the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution. Advances in data mining technology may make it possible to discover more personally identifiable information or profiles in the Collections. The Archive may disclose any information it collects from Users if the Archive believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to enforce its Terms of Use or other policies, to comply with the law, to comply with legal process, to operate its systems properly, or to protect the rights or property of itself, its Users, or others. It is possible that the computers at the Archive could become compromised by others and that the information on the Archive’s computers could be collected and disseminated without the knowledge or consent of the Archive. While the Archive endeavors to block \"crackers\" from breaking into its machines, the Archive is not responsible or liable for any such unauthorized uses of the Archive or its data. How to Update Researcher Registration Information Researchers can help the Archive maintain the accuracy of their information by notifying the Archive of any changes in their address, title, phone number, or email address. Contact the Archive by email at info@archive.org to see, update, or delete your information. Copyright Policy 10 March 2001 The Internet Archive respects the intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights of others. The Internet Archive may, in appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, remove certain content or disable access to content that appears to infringe the copyright or other intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your copyright has been violated by material available through the Internet Archive, please provide the Internet Archive Copyright Agent with the following information: Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; An exact description of where the material about which you complain is located within the Internet Archive collections; Your address, telephone number, and email address; A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the owner of the copyright interest involved or are authorized to act on behalf of that owner; and Your electronic or physical signature. The Internet Archive Copyright Agent can be reached as follows: Internet Archive Copyright Agent Internet Archive Presidio of San Francisco P.O. Box 29244 San Francisco, CA 94129 Phone: 415-561-6767 Email: info@archive.org For More Information If you have any questions or comments regarding these terms and policies or the Archive’s data collection practices, please contact the Archive at info@archive.org or Internet Archive, PO Box 29244, San Francisco, CA 94129-0244, phone 415-561-6767.

Forbes.com picks up AP story on the Archive! \"When a website dies, it goes to Heaven...\" SF Chronicle spotlights Tech Award winners Member About the Internet Archive The Internet Archive is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that was founded to build an Internet library, with the purpose of offering permanent access for researchers, historians, and scholars to historical collections that exist in digital format. Founded in 1996 and located in the Presidio of San Francisco, the Archive has been receiving data donations from Alexa Internet and others. In late 1999, the organization started to grow to include more well-rounded collections. Now the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software as well as archived web pages in our collections. Why the Archive is Building an 'Internet Library' Libraries exist to preserve society's cultural artifacts and to provide access to them. If libraries are to continue to foster education and scholarship in this era of digital technology, it's essential for them to extend those functions into the digital world. Many early movies were recycled to recover the silver in the film. The Library of Alexandria - an ancient center of learning containing a copy of every book in the world - was eventually burned to the ground. Even now, at the turn of the 21st century, no comprehensive archives of television or radio programs exist. But without cultural artifacts, civilization has no memory and no mechanism to learn from its successes and failures. And paradoxically, with the explosion of the Internet, we live in what Danny Hillis has referred to as our \"digital dark age.\" The Internet Archive is working to prevent the Internet - a new medium with major historical significance - and other \"born-digital\" materials from disappearing into the past. Collaborating with institutions including the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian, we are working to preserve a record for generations to come. Open and free access to literature and other writings has long been considered essential to education and to the maintenance of an open society. Public and philanthropic enterprises have supported it through the ages. The Internet Archive is opening its collections to researchers, historians, and scholars. The Archive has no vested interest in the discoveries of the users of its collections, nor is it a grant-making organization. At present, the size of our Web collection is such that using it requires programming skills. However, we are hopeful about the development of tools and methods that will give the general public easy and meaningful access to our collective history. In addition to developing our own collections, we are working to promote the formation of other Internet libraries in the United States and elsewhere. Find out How to make a Monetary Donation to the Archvive About our announcement and discussion lists on Internet libraries and movie archives as well as our user forums Future Libraries - How People Envision Using Internet Libraries From ephemera to artifact: Internet libraries can change the content of the Internet from ephemera to enduring artifacts of our political and cultural lives. \"I believe historians need every possible piece of paper and archived byte of digital data they can muster. The Smithsonian Institution sees the value, and has affiliated with the Archive to preserve the 1996 campaign Web sites, official and unofficial.\" Dan Gillmor, computing editor, San Jose Mercury News, 1 September 1996 Protecting our right to know: Most states have pre-Internet sunshine laws that require public access to government documents. Yet while the Internet has generally increased public access to information, states have just begun to amend those laws to reflect today's Internet environment. According to Bill Chamberlin, director of the Marion Brechner Citizen Access Project at the University of Florida's College of Journalism and Communications, such laws are being enacted \"piecemeal, one state at a time,\" and cover information that varies widely in nature - everything from \"all public records\" to specialized information such as education reports and the licensing status of medical practitioners. In the meantime, while public officials are posting more information on the Internet than their state legislatures require, there's little regulatory control over exactly what is posted, when it's taken off, or how often it's updated. This leaves a gap that online libraries can help to fill. Exercising our \"right to remember\": Without paper libraries, it would be hard to exercise our \"right to remember\" our political history or hold government accountable. With much of the public's business now moving from paper to digital media, Internet libraries are certain to become essential in maintaining that right. Imagine, for instance, how news coverage of an election campaign might suffer if journalists had only limited access to previous statements that candidates had made in the media. \"The Internet Archive is a service so essential that its founding is bound to be looked back on with the fondness and respect that people now have for the public libraries seeded by Andrew Carnegie a century ago.... Digitized information, especially on the Internet, has such rapid turnover these days that total loss is the norm. Civilization is developing severe amnesia as a result; indeed it may have become too amnesiac already to notice the problem properly. The Internet Archive is the beginning of a cure - the beginning of complete, detailed, accessible, searchable memory for society, and not just scholars this time, but everyone.\" Stewart Brand, president, The Long Now Foundation Establishing Internet centers internationally: What is a country without a memory of its cultural heritage? Internet libraries are the place to preserve the aspect of a country's heritage that exists on the Internet. Tracing the way our language changes: During the late 19th century, James Murray, a professor at Oxford University, built the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary by sending copies of selected books to \"men of letters\" who volunteered to search them for the first occurrences of words and to trace the migration of their various meanings. Internet libraries could allow linguists to automate much of this extremely labor-intensive process. Tracking the Web's evolution: Historians, sociologists, and journalists could use Internet libraries to hold up a mirror to society. For example, they might ask when different ethnic groups or special interests or certain businesses became a presence on the Internet. \"We don't know where this Internet is going, and once we get there it will be very instructive to look back.\" Donald Heath, president of the Internet Society in Reston, Virginia Reviving dead links: A few services - such as UC Berkeley's Digital Library Project, the Online Computer Library Center, and Alexa Internet are starting to offer access to archived versions of Web pages when those pages have been removed from the Web. This means that if you get a \"404 - Page Not Found\" error, you'll still be able to find a version of the page. Understanding the economy: Economists could use Archive data such as link structures - what and how many links a site contains - to investigate how the Web affects commerce. Finding out what the Web tells us about ourselves: Researchers could use data on links and traffic to better understand human behavior and communication. \"Researchers could use the Archive's Web snapshots in combination with usage statistics to compare how people in different countries use the Web over long periods of time.... Political scientists and sociologists could use the data to study how public opinion gets formed. For example, suppose a device for increasing privacy became available: Would it change usage patterns?\" Bernardo Huberman, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center \"The Internet Archive has created a kind of test tube that allows a broad range of researchers to analyze the Web in ways that have never been possible before. What makes this type of research unique is that it often requires the fusion of traditional tools and techniques with new methods, and it results in the development of new theories, techniques, and metrics.\" James Pitkow, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center Looking back: With a \"way-back machine\" - a device that displayed the Web as it looked on a given date - historians and others would literally have a window on the past. How would you use an Internet library? Related Projects and Research Internet libraries raise many issues in a range of areas, including archiving technology, copyright, privacy and free speech, trademark, trade secrets, import/export issues, stolen property, pornography, the question of who will have access to the libraries, and more.

Storage and Preservation The Archive has two practical considerations in dealing with digital collections: How to store massive amounts of data How to preserve the data for posterity Storage Storing the Archive's collections involves parsing, indexing, and physically encoding the data. With the Internet collections growing at exponential rates, this task poses an ongoing challenge. Our hardware consists of PCs with clusters of IDE hard drives. Data is stored on DLT tape and hard drives in various appropriate formats, depending on the collection. Web data is received and stored in archive format of 100-megabyte ARC files made up of many individual files. Alexa Internet (currently the source of all crawls in our collections) is proposing ARC as a standard for archiving Internet objects. See Alexa for the format specification. Preservation Preservation is the ongoing task of permanently protecting stored resources from damage or destruction. The main issues are guarding against the consequences of accidents and data degradation and maintaining the accessibility of data as formats become obsolete. Accidents: Any medium or site used to store data is potentially vulnerable to accidents and natural disasters. Maintaining copies of the Archiveï¿½s collections at multiple sites can help alleviate this risk. Part of the collection is already handled this way, and we are proceeding as quickly as possible to do the same with the rest. Migration: Over time, storage media can degrade to a point where the data becomes permanently irretrievable. Although DLT tape is rated to last 30 years, the industry rule of thumb is to migrate data every 10 years. We no longer use tapes for storage, however. Please take a look at our page on our Petabox system for more information on our storage systems. Data formats: As advances are made in software applications, many data formats become obsolete. We will be collecting software and emulators that will aid future researchers, historians, and scholars in their research.
